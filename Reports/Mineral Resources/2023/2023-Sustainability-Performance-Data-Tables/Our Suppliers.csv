,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,"We recognise that through our supply chain and operations, we could be indirectly exposed to the risk of modern slavery. We are committed to preventing instances of modern slavery in our business and our supply chain. We have set out expectations of our suppliers, and their supply chains, to uphold and respect human rights, comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and prohibit the use of all forms of forced, compulsory and child labour practices. We are committed to continuously improve and strengthen our approach to addressing and preventing modern slavery over time. 

As part of our reporting obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth), we develop an annual Modern Slavery Statement, which outlines our commitment and approach to identifying and mitigating risks of modern slavery within our operations and supply chain. Our Modern Slavery Statement is available on our website at https://www.mineralresources.com.au/",,,,,,,
