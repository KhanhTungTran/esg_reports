,CONTENTS,,,,,CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Climate change presents opportunities and risks for MinRes. Our innovative capabilities as a mining services provider positions us well to respond to climate change drivers by developing energy efficient materials handling solutions at our operations and displacing diesel fuel usage. 

Using the TCFD recommendations, climate-related risks are characterised as either physical risks relating to the physical impacts of climate change, or transition risks related to the risks associated with transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Climate-related opportunities are characterised in line with resource efficiency, energy source, product or service, market or resilience opportunities. 

MinRes identifies and assesses climate-related risks and opportunities through the following activities:
·  Assessed physical climate information and projections for Australia for the areas where MinRes operations are located. This includes a series of climate indicators for 2030 and 2050 under Scenario 1, 2 and 3, including review of average temperature increases, maximum temperature        increases, rainfall, days above 35°C and 99.9 percentile rainfall days
· Embedded quarterly risk assessment workshops to survey and review and rank likelihood and consequence of the identified climate-related risks, using MinRes’ enterprise risk-rating matrix.

The financial consequences of minor risks are set at less than 2 per cent of EBITDA or cash flow; with the financial consequence of critical risks set at over 10 per cent of EBITDA or cashflow, announceable to the Australian Stock Exchange. From a likelihood perspective, risks are rated from almost certain, where the event has a greater than 85 per cent expected probability of occurring (may occur throughout a year) to rare less than 10 per cent expected probability (occur once in more than 20 years).

The outcome of this process is a list of identified climate-related risks and opportunities, detailed in the tables below.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This increases the risks associated with employee health and safety due to more extreme-heat days and longer-term exposure to higher temperatures. This may also result in health and safety impacts on the workforce due to heat stress and/or require alterations to current rostering schedules, which may increase operational costs. Higher temperatures may also necessitate increased air conditioning for cooling of offices and buildings resulting in increased energy cost and GHG emissions.","· Increased operating costs and capital costs

· Net zero Trajectory (Less likely)","Climate change will result in increased temperatures and reduced rainfall where MinRes operates with Utah Point Hub, Ashburton Hub and South West Creek Hub operations rainfall potentially decreasing by 1.5 per cent to 6 per cent under differing scenarios. This increases the risk associated with water availability and quality for MinRes operations. While water risks vary across the locations where MinRes operates, this risk may result in the costly import of water into certain locations unless recycling rates can be increased. If extreme climatic events do get worse with increased water stress, floods, droughts, sea level rises as predicted by the climate models, further pro-active management and mitigation measures may have to be taken to ensure that operations do not experience business interruption and loss of production. Water related infrastructure, such as water supply reservoirs, dam spillways and river levees, have been designed for historic rainfall patterns. 

Upgrading this infrastructure to cope with increased flooding and drought may be required if weather patterns change.",· Increased operating costs and capital costs,,Minor,Possible,Medium,>2% and <5% of EBITDA or cash flow,,,,,,,,,,,,

· Paris Aligned (Likely)
· Current Trajectory (Likely)
· Net zero Trajectory/Current Trajectory and Paris Aligned (Equally likely)","Operational efficiency: Driving decarbonisation through operational efficiency will play a key role in mitigating climate change. Energy savings in diesel consumption can be gained through activities such as improved payload management, idle time management and logistics and haulage optimisation. These activities are an opportunity to return economic value while also reducing air pollutants emitted from construction and mining operations. Generating greater income or returns for the same or lower cost than an alternative may present commercial advantage to MinRes.

Water: Long-term climate change has the potential to impact water availability and quality. As such, demonstrated efficiency in water use and management may provide enhanced corporate reputation and/or investor ratings, new business opportunities and commercial advantage to MinRes.",,,,"· New and diverse revenue streams 
· Reduction in operation costs ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,Energy Source,"· Net zero Trajectory (More likely)
· Paris Aligned (More Likely)
· Current Trajectory (Likely)","Diesel displacement: As the focus on addressing climate change increases, emission intensive fuels, such as diesel, will be increasingly under the spotlight. The current industry reliance on diesel for remote mining operations provides a specific opportunity for lower-emission energy sources, such as gas, to be used more extensively. This may present an opportunity for MinRes to develop solutions for its own operations and customers, providing alternative revenue streams. This may strengthen MinRes’ competitive advantage, enhance its corporate reputation and allow for the development of new business opportunities.

Electrification: Addressing climate change will drive coordinated efforts for large scale electrification in the mining industry. Opportunities to replace a significant volume of fossil fuels on our mine sites will result in lowering energy costs and emissions. Additionally, if renewable electricity is consumed, the greenhouse gas emissions lower significantly.

Solar and battery: In all three climate scenarios, large-scale solar and battery is expected to perform well as a micro-grid energy solution that is becoming increasingly commercially viable to support decarbonisation. MinRes can reduce its operational reliance on diesel power plants through solar, while reducing costs and increasing reliability of energy supply. In September 2020, MinRes acquired Wonmunna iron ore mine, and with consideration of a carbon price, has commenced rollout of a 2.1MW solar array along with a battery storage facility, to be commissioned in under two years from project onboarding.

Energy storage: Renewable energy technology and electric vehicles will drive increased battery demand for energy storage under both the Net Zero Trajectory and Paris Aligned pathway scenarios. Energy storage supports solar and wind power enabling full potential gains of the energy generated. As the world’s demand for electric vehicles and energy storage grows, this could increase demand for MinRes’ lithium product which has a significant application in batteries.

Hydrogen: Renewable hydrogen-based fuels are projected to form part of Australia’s energy mix to help drive down emissions and provide an opportunity to build a competitive export industry. The Low Emissions Technology Statement has set the goal for hydrogen production below AUD$2 per kilogram and the Government’s National Hydrogen Strategy sets the vision for commercial renewable hydrogen exports by 2030. As technology evolves, MinRes will canvas opportunities to adopt new technology once commercial scalability has been achieved.

Wind power: Is currently one of the most cost-effective sources of large-scale renewable energy. Potential opportunities exist for MinRes to advance into this sector of renewables with onboarding of future assets.

Geothermal1: Provides an opportunity for baseload power sourced from the production of hot water from sedimentary aquifers at depth, where production can be sustained over time. Geothermal is an emerging industry in Australia. It has been estimated Australia’s total energy requirements for 26,000 years could be supplied by one per cent of the geothermal resources at less than five kilometres in depth and at temperatures greater than 150°C (Geoscience Australia, 2021) .

· Current Trajectory (Less likely)","Natural gas/LNG: Our short-term transitionary decarbonisation efforts will include gas alternatives. Our wholly owned subsidiary, MinRes Energy, continues to identify and explore opportunities to develop and secure low-cost gas solutions to support the growth and development of MinRes and the broader resource industry and communities in Western Australia.

Demand for lower carbon goods and services: As the world transitions to a lower-emission economy, the drive for resource and carbon efficiency will increase the demand for alternative light-weight products in mining operations such as carbon fibre mining components. This provides potential for MinRes to identify opportunities to invest in and utilise emerging technologies applicable to the mining sector. MinRes’ portfolio is aimed at enabling a low carbon future with our lithium resources to assist in indirectly reducing energy consumption and environmental impacts. 

The MinRes Board is committed to no investments in thermal coal.

Mining innovation: MinRes has a strong internal capability across business divisions to be able to implement highly technical solutions. Leveraging understanding of the requirements of a net zero transition will support the provision of services to brownfields and new greenfield clients, while continuing to drive innovation through our carbon fibre technologies, our NextGen crushing technology and jumbo road train automation.",,,,"· Diversified portfolio

MinRes is set to benefit from potential additional demand projected under all scenarios over the next 30 years.

Carbon pricing: In response to climate change, governments are seeking to reduce emissions from high emitting industry through the implementation of rapidly rising carbon pricing mechanisms, updated policy and regulatory reforms. MinRes anticipates adoption will be accelerated under a Net Zero Trajectory scenario. While there is a level of risk assumed under different carbon pricing and regulatory scenarios, such as those described in Table 1, the opportunity exists to improve MinRes’ competitive position given our GHG emissions performance compared to our peers and our practical strategy in place to enable net zero by 2050.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
