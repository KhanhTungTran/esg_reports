4,,CONTENTS,,,,,GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,,,,,,,Our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are directly related to our energy use and growth of our operations. MinRes calculates its direct (Scope 1) and energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions for entities under its operational control in alignment with the GHG Protocol and the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

20,,,,,,,1 MinRes scope 1 and scope 2 emissions only occur in Australia and are generated from metals and mining production activities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,,,,,,,2 External assurance has been obtained over scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. Refer to page 181 of the 2023 Sustainability Report for a copy of the Independent Limited Assurance Statement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,,,,,,,Note: emissions are not inclusive of Wodgina in accordance with the Clean Energy Regulations and our JV arrangement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,,,,,,,"We use emission factors disclosed in the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination, 2008 made under subsection 10(3) of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Act 2007. The emission factors applied are for metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, including the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,,,,,,,"Global Warming Potential (GWP) values are defined in the NGER Regulations, 2008 based on the 100-year GWP timeframe referenced in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeÃ¢ÂÂs (IPCC) 2007 Fourth Assessment Report. No biogenic CO2 emissions have been included in our scope 1 GHG emissions, while scope 2 GHG emissions are calculated using a location-based approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
