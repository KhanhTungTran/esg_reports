47,,,,,,,Resource Efficiency,ÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory (More likely)\nÃÂ· Paris Aligned (Likely)\nÃÂ· Current Trajectory (Likely)\nÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory/Current Trajectory and Paris Aligned (Equally likely),"Operational efficiency: Driving decarbonisation through operational efficiency will play a key role in mitigating climate change. Energy savings in diesel consumption can be gained through activities such as improved payload management, idle time management and logistics and haulage optimisation. These activities are an opportunity to return economic value while also reducing air pollutants emitted from construction and mining operations. Generating greater income or returns for the same or lower cost than an alternative may present commercial advantage to MinRes.\n\nWater: Long-term climate change has the potential to impact water availability and quality. As such, demonstrated efficiency in water use and management may provide enhanced corporate reputation and/or investor ratings, new business opportunities and commercial advantage to MinRes.",,,,ÃÂ· New and diverse revenue streams \nÃÂ· Reduction in operation costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,,,,,,,Energy Source,ÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory (More likely)\nÃÂ· Paris Aligned (More Likely)\nÃÂ· Current Trajectory (Likely),"Diesel displacement: As the focus on addressing climate change increases, emission intensive fuels, such as diesel, will be increasingly under the spotlight. The current industry reliance on diesel for remote mining operations provides a specific opportunity for lower-emission energy sources, such as gas, to be used more extensively. This may present an opportunity for MinRes to develop solutions for its own operations and customers, providing alternative revenue streams. This may strengthen MinResÃ¢ÂÂ competitive advantage, enhance its corporate reputation and allow for the development of new business opportunities.\n\nElectrification: Addressing climate change will drive coordinated efforts for large scale electrification in the mining industry. Opportunities to replace a significant volume of fossil fuels on our mine sites will result in lowering energy costs and emissions. Additionally, if renewable electricity is consumed, the greenhouse gas emissions lower significantly.\n\nSolar and battery: In all three climate scenarios, large-scale solar and battery is expected to perform well as a micro-grid energy solution that is becoming increasingly commercially viable to support decarbonisation. MinRes can reduce its operational reliance on diesel power plants through solar, while reducing costs and increasing reliability of energy supply. In September 2020, MinRes acquired Wonmunna iron ore mine, and with consideration of a carbon price, has commenced rollout of a 2.1MW solar array along with a battery storage facility, to be commissioned in under two years from project onboarding.\n\nEnergy storage: Renewable energy technology and electric vehicles will drive increased battery demand for energy storage under both the Net Zero Trajectory and Paris Aligned pathway scenarios. Energy storage supports solar and wind power enabling full potential gains of the energy generated. As the worldÃ¢ÂÂs demand for electric vehicles and energy storage grows, this could increase demand for MinResÃ¢ÂÂ lithium product which has a significant application in batteries.\n\nHydrogen: Renewable hydrogen-based fuels are projected to form part of AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs energy mix to help drive down emissions and provide an opportunity to build a competitive export industry. The Low Emissions Technology Statement has set the goal for hydrogen production below AUD$2 per kilogram and the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs National Hydrogen Strategy sets the vision for commercial renewable hydrogen exports by 2030. As technology evolves, MinRes will canvas opportunities to adopt new technology once commercial scalability has been achieved.\n\nWind power: Is currently one of the most cost-effective sources of large-scale renewable energy. Potential opportunities exist for MinRes to advance into this sector of renewables with onboarding of future assets.\n\nGeothermal1: Provides an opportunity for baseload power sourced from the production of hot water from sedimentary aquifers at depth, where production can be sustained over time. Geothermal is an emerging industry in Australia. It has been estimated AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs total energy requirements for 26,000 years could be supplied by one per cent of the geothermal resources at less than five kilometres in depth and at temperatures greater than 150ÃÂ°C (Geoscience Australia, 2021) .\n",,,,ÃÂ· Reduction in operation costs\nÃÂ· Increased productivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,,,,,,,Products and services,ÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory (More likely)\nÃÂ· Paris Aligned (Likely)\nÃÂ· Current Trajectory (Less likely),"Natural gas/LNG: Our short-term transitionary decarbonisation efforts will include gas alternatives. Our wholly owned subsidiary, MinRes Energy, continues to identify and explore opportunities to develop and secure low-cost gas solutions to support the growth and development of MinRes and the broader resource industry and communities in Western Australia.\n\nDemand for lower carbon goods and services: As the world transitions to a lower-emission economy, the drive for resource and carbon efficiency will increase the demand for alternative light-weight products in mining operations such as carbon fibre mining components. This provides potential for MinRes to identify opportunities to invest in and utilise emerging technologies applicable to the mining sector. MinResÃ¢ÂÂ portfolio is aimed at enabling a low carbon future with our lithium resources to assist in indirectly reducing energy consumption and environmental impacts. \n\nThe MinRes Board is committed to no investments in thermal coal.\n\nMining innovation: MinRes has a strong internal capability across business divisions to be able to implement highly technical solutions. Leveraging understanding of the requirements of a net zero transition will support the provision of services to brownfields and new greenfield clients, while continuing to drive innovation through our carbon fibre technologies, our NextGen crushing technology and jumbo road train automation.",,,,ÃÂ· Diversified portfolio\nÃÂ· Reduction in operation costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MinRes is set to benefit from potential additional demand projected under all scenarios over the next 30 years.\n\nCarbon pricing: In response to climate change, governments are seeking to reduce emissions from high emitting industry through the implementation of rapidly rising carbon pricing mechanisms, updated policy and regulatory reforms. MinRes anticipates adoption will be accelerated under a Net Zero Trajectory scenario. While there is a level of risk assumed under different carbon pricing and regulatory scenarios, such as those described in Table 1, the opportunity exists to improve MinResÃ¢ÂÂ competitive position given our GHG emissions performance compared to our peers and our practical strategy in place to enable net zero by 2050.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,,,,,,,Resilience,ÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory (More likely)\nÃÂ· Paris Aligned (Likely)\nÃÂ· Current Trajectory (Less likely),"Design for net zero: Planned greenfield operations dominate MinRes future emissions profile and commissioning these new operations provides a unique opportunity to design them as Ã¢ÂÂnet zero readyÃ¢ÂÂ. Early consideration of future potential infrastructure and operational characteristics required for a net zero mine prevents the lock-in of high emissions equipment. \n\nLearnings taken from MinRes existing sites, applied to our planned greenfield sites, provides an opportunity for MinRes to increase resilience of its operations and services under a changing climate. This may result in enhanced competitive advantage over the long-term and reduced capital expenditure on climate change adaptation.",,,,ÃÂ· Diversification of revenue streams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
