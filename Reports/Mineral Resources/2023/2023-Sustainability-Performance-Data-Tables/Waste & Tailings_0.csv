7,,,,,,,"We are committed to appropriately managing and reducing waste generated from our operations and sites. Our mining operations generate mining-related waste including waste rock and tailings, and non-mineral waste streams in the form of general waste, comingled recycling, construction and demolition, tyres and rubber, and hazardous waste types including liquid, solid and septic waste. \n\nTo ensure waste is appropriately managed, MinRes monitors and reports on all hazardous and non-hazardous waste streams in accordance with the Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Act 2007 and landfill licence conditions issued by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation.\n\nOur waste performance metrics are detailed below.",,,,,,,,,,,
