95,,,,,,,"MinRes is committed to investigating alternative and renewable energy options to support the achievement of net zero emissions by 2050. Currently, diesel is the primary energy source for mining equipment, transportation, and haulage of materials over long distances and for electricity generation at some of our non-grid-connected operations. While we have made significant progress in non-diesel electricity generation through the development of the Mt Marion gas-fired power station with LNG storage and vaporisation, we continue to investigate additional ways to reduce our reliance on diesel fuel with new developments in the Pilbara and Ashburton Hubs. \n\nEmission reduction initiatives active within the reporting year are detailed in the 2023 Sustainability Report on page 164.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
