,,,,,,"MinRes' mining operations generate mining-related waste, including tailings and waste rock. Tailings are a by-product of the mining process, consisting of fine-grained processed rock or soil left over from the separation of the commodities of value from the ore within which they occur.

Tailings management is a critical part of managing the risks of the waste produced from the mining process. These risks can range from potential consequences of a Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) failure through to groundwater impact due to seepage. 

MinRes prioritises the safety of a TSF through all phases of the life cycle with consideration of many factors through project conception, planning, design, construction, operation, closure and post closure. We are committed to operating in line with the 15 principles and 77 requirements set out by the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) published by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).
