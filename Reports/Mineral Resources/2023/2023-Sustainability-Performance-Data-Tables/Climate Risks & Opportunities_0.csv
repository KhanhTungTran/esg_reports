4,,CONTENTS,,,,,CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,,,,,,,"Climate change presents opportunities and risks for MinRes. Our innovative capabilities as a mining services provider positions us well to respond to climate change drivers by developing energy efficient materials handling solutions at our operations and displacing diesel fuel usage. \n\nUsing the TCFD recommendations, climate-related risks are characterised as either physical risks relating to the physical impacts of climate change, or transition risks related to the risks associated with transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Climate-related opportunities are characterised in line with resource efficiency, energy source, product or service, market or resilience opportunities. \n\nMinRes identifies and assesses climate-related risks and opportunities through the following activities:\nÃÂ· Assessed physical climate information and projections for Australia for the areas where MinRes operations are located. This includes a series of climate indicators for 2030 and 2050 under Scenario 1, 2 and 3, including review of average temperature increases, maximum temperature increases, rainfall, days above 35ÃÂ°C and 99.9 percentile rainfall days\nÃÂ· Embedded quarterly risk assessment workshops to survey and review and rank likelihood and consequence of the identified climate-related risks, using MinResÃ¢ÂÂ enterprise risk-rating matrix.\n\nThe financial consequences of minor risks are set at less than 2 per cent of EBITDA or cash flow; with the financial consequence of critical risks set at over 10 per cent of EBITDA or cashflow, announceable to the Australian Stock Exchange. From a likelihood perspective, risks are rated from almost certain, where the event has a greater than 85 per cent expected probability of occurring (may occur throughout a year) to rare less than 10 per cent expected probability (occur once in more than 20 years).\n\nThe outcome of this process is a list of identified climate-related risks and opportunities, detailed in the tables below.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

25,,,,,,,PHYSICAL - ACUTE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,,,,,,,Extreme events,ÃÂ· Current Trajectory (More likely)\nÃÂ· Paris Aligned (Likely)\nÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory (Likely),"Changes to the intensity and frequency of extreme events such as cyclones, floods and fire events has the potential to increase the risk of damage to MinRes facilities and existing infrastructure such as access roads, rail lines and port facilities. This has the potential to impact construction and development of new facilities and infrastructure, which may result in interruptions and delays to business operations, disruptions to supply chains, transportation and logistics (such as rail and shipping schedules). Furthermore, this also has potential to harm the health and safety of the MinRes workforce, cause disruptions to supply chains, transportation and logistics (such as rail and shipping schedules).",ÃÂ· Increased operating costs and capital costs\nÃÂ· Reduced revenue from decreased production capacity \nÃÂ· Reduced revenue and higher costs from negative impacts on employees\nÃÂ· Shortened asset mine life\nÃÂ· Increased insurance premiums and potentially reduced availability on assets in high-risk locations,,Minor,Possible,Medium,>2% and <5% of EBITDA or cash flow,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,,,,,,,PHYSICAL - CHRONIC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,,,,,,,Average and maximum temperatures,ÃÂ· Current Trajectory (More likely)\nÃÂ· Paris Aligned (Likely)\nÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory (Less likely),"Climate change is likely to cause an increase in the long-term average and maximum temperatures in areas of MinRes operations, including construction projects. This increases the risks associated with employee health and safety due to more extreme-heat days and longer-term exposure to higher temperatures. This may also result in health and safety impacts on the workforce due to heat stress and/or require alterations to current rostering schedules, which may increase operational costs. Higher temperatures may also necessitate increased air conditioning for cooling of offices and buildings resulting in increased energy cost and GHG emissions.",ÃÂ· Increased operating costs and capital costs\nÃÂ· Reduced revenue from decreased production capacity\nÃÂ· Policy and legal risks intensified,,Minor,Unlikely,Low,< 2% of EBITDA or cash flow,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,,,,,,Water,ÃÂ· Current Trajectory (More likely)\nÃÂ· Paris Aligned (Likely)\nÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory (Less likely),"Climate change will result in increased temperatures and reduced rainfall where MinRes operates with Utah Point Hub, Ashburton Hub and South West Creek Hub operations rainfall potentially decreasing by 1.5 per cent to 6 per cent under differing scenarios. This increases the risk associated with water availability and quality for MinRes operations. While water risks vary across the locations where MinRes operates, this risk may result in the costly import of water into certain locations unless recycling rates can be increased. If extreme climatic events do get worse with increased water stress, floods, droughts, sea level rises as predicted by the climate models, further pro-active management and mitigation measures may have to be taken to ensure that operations do not experience business interruption and loss of production. Water related infrastructure, such as water supply reservoirs, dam spillways and river levees, have been designed for historic rainfall patterns. \n\nUpgrading this infrastructure to cope with increased flooding and drought may be required if weather patterns change.",ÃÂ· Increased operating costs and capital costs,,Minor,Possible,Medium,>2% and <5% of EBITDA or cash flow,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,,,,,,,TRANSITION - POLICY AND LEGAL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,,,,,,,Carbon Pricing,ÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory (More likely)\nÃÂ· Paris Aligned (Likely)\nÃÂ· Current Trajectory (Less likely),"In response to climate change, governments will seek to reduce emissions from industry through the implementation of rapidly rising carbon pricing mechanisms, such as emission trading schemes or a carbon tax. The world is transitioning to a blanket carbon price estimated by the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices to reach $50 -$100 USD per tonne by 2030 (where carbon cost pass through is normal practice). This change presents a risk as there may be a period when increased carbon costs cannot be passed through to customers.",ÃÂ·ÃÂ Increased operating costs\nÃÂ· Increased costs and/or reduced demand for products and services\nÃÂ· Legal fines and costs,,Minimal,Likely,Low,<2% of EBITDA or cash flow,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,,,,,,,Increased data collection and reporting requirements,ÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory (More likely)\nÃÂ· Paris Aligned (Likely)\nÃÂ· Current Trajectory (Less likely),"Governments, regulatory bodies and other interested stakeholders are responding to climate change by seeking increased disclosure of GHG emissions from industry. This poses a risk that the calculation and disclosure of Scope 3 emissions (non-operational emissions associated with upstream and downstream activities) may become mandatory. This would place increased data collection and reporting and resourcing requirements on MinRes.",ÃÂ· Increased operating costs\nÃÂ· Increased costs and/or reduced demand for products and services,,Minimal,Likely,Low,<2% of EBITDA or cash flow,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,,,,,,,Supply chain management,ÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory (More likely)\nÃÂ· Paris Aligned (Likely)\nÃÂ· Current Trajectory (Less likely),"As the global economy seeks to address climate change, organisations unable to manage climate risks and decarbonise may not meet customer, supplier or stakeholder hurdle requirements in their procurement, supply or support practices and policies. This may pose potential adverse impacts on MinRes reputation, supply chain and market perceptions; as well as potentially limit future business.",ÃÂ· Increased operating costs\nÃÂ· Increased costs and/or reduced demand for products and services,,Minor,Possible,Medium,>2% and <5% of EBITDA or cash flow,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,,,,,,,Natural gas/Liquefied natural gas (LNG),ÃÂ· Net zero Trajectory (More likely)\nÃÂ· Paris Aligned (Likely)\nÃÂ· Current Trajectory (Less likely),"Low-carbon renewable energy and storage technologies have the potential to produce lower cost energy than higher emission alternatives. This poses a risk of reduced value associated with MinRes natural gas assets. This may result in potential adverse financial impacts, loss of business opportunities and adverse impacts on market perception.",ÃÂ· Increased operating costs\nÃÂ· Increased costs and/or reduced demand for products and services,,Major,Possible,High,>7% and <10% of EBITDA or cash flow\n,,,,,,,,,,,,
