The Sustainability Committee meets at least twice per year and is informed about climate-relates issues at each session. The Committee is deemed to have the appropriate skills, knowledge, experience and competencies to have appropriate oversight of the risks and controls relevant to MinRes. Where necessary, each member of the Committee may seek independent professional advice on matters relating to their responsibilities.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing the organisational structure of the Company to ensure appropriate resources and processes are available and are being used to eliminate or minimise risk. The Committee also has oversight of the Groupâs Enterprise Risk Register, including climate change risks, controls and mitigating actions, which is presented to the Board quarterly.\n\nIn line with the Climate Change Policy, climate-related issues are considered throughout strategic planning processes as well as when setting the performance objectives, monitoring implementation and annual performance. The MinRes Board oversees climate performance through the monthly tracking of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with oversight delegated to the above two committees.</td>

These scenarios described a combination of possible future physical and socioeconomic impacts to which we may be exposed:\nâ¢ Scenario 1: âOrderly and Paris-aligned transition to a low-carbon economyâ is aligned with the Paris Agreement to keep global temperature increases below 2Â°C above pre-industrial average temperatures and is characterised by globally coordinated and government-led decarbonisation, where the worst physical impacts of climate change are avoided\nâ¢ Scenario 2: âHigh GHG emissions with limited global coordinationâ is aligned with global temperate increases of approximately 4Â°C above pre-industrial average temperatures and is characterised by business-as-usual conditions with limited and uncoordinated climate change regulation and activity\nâ¢ Scenario 3: âNet-Zero Emissions by 2050â is aligned with the most recent special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), limiting warming to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels, and is characterised by energy demand reductions, decarbonisation of electricity and other fuels, electrification of energy end use, stronger climate policy mitigation pathways consistent with high likelihood of carbon pricing imposed directly or implicitly by regulatory policies.\n\nOur climate scenario analyses indicate the businessâ long-term resilience and value generation under the three possible climate decarbonisation scenarios including a 1.5 - 2Â°C outcome.
