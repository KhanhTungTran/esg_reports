,,,,,,Describe the Board’s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.,"
The MinRes Board is supported by the Audit and Risk Committee and Sustainability Committee in overseeing the governance of climate-related risks and opportunities. 

The MinRes Sustainability Committee Charter outlines the Committees responsibility over the Companies' climate change strategy as well as the ways risks are identified, assessed, managed and mitigated. The Sustainability Committee meets at least twice per year and is informed about climate-relates issues at each session. The Committee is deemed to have the appropriate skills, knowledge, experience and competencies to have appropriate oversight of the risks and controls relevant to MinRes. Where necessary, each member of the Committee may seek independent professional advice on matters relating to their responsibilities.

The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing the organisational structure of the Company to ensure appropriate resources and processes are available and are being used to eliminate or minimise risk. The Committee also has oversight of the Group’s Enterprise Risk Register, including climate change risks, controls and mitigating actions, which is presented to the Board quarterly.

In line with the Climate Change Policy, climate-related issues are considered throughout strategic planning processes as well as when setting the performance objectives, monitoring implementation and annual performance. The MinRes Board oversees climate performance through the monthly tracking of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with oversight delegated to the above two committees. ",,2023 Sustainability Report,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,Describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.,"The Executive Leadership Team (ELT) is responsible for the execution of the Company-wide approach of the transition to a low-carbon economy. Key climate-related risks and opportunities are included in the Group’s Enterprise Risk Register, which is reviewed with Company subject matter experts and presented to the Audit and Risk Committee and Sustainability Committee on a quarterly basis (refer to our 2023 Sustainability Report - Governance for further information).

The MinRes Decarbonisation Working Group is responsible for matters and activities related specifically to climate change and decarbonisation abatement projects to manage our carbon emissions. The Group supports the integration of climate change strategy into our business and progressing internal GHG targets across operations, ensuring that these are aligned with the Board’s commitment to our target of net zero operational emissions by 2050. The Decarbonisation Working Group meets monthly and is comprised of KMP and subject matter experts (refer to our 2023 Sustainability Report - Decarbonisation Working Group for more information).",,2023 Sustainability Report,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,STRATEGY,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organisation has identified over the short, medium, and long term.","Climate-related risks are characterised as either physical risks relating to the physical impacts of climate change, or transition risks related to the risks associated with transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Climate-related opportunities are characterised in line with resource efficiency, energy source, product or service, market, or resilience opportunities. 

MinRes identifies and assesses climate-related risks and opportunities through: 
• assessment of physical climate information and projections for Australia for the areas where MinRes operations are located. This includes a series of climate indicators for 2030 and 2050 under Scenario 1, 2 and 3, including review of average temperature increases, maximum temperature increases, rainfall, days above 35°C and 99.9 percentile rainfall days. This information is used to identify the risks and opportunities that may affect MinRes’ business activities 
• climate focused workshops and interviews engaging management, senior executives and subject matter experts across both corporate and operations to identify climate-related risks and opportunities 
• embedding risk assessment processes to review and rank likelihood and consequence of the identified climate-related risks, using MinRes’ enterprise risk-rating matrix. Climate risks are reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure the ranked likelihood and consequence of the identified risks and controls remains appropriate.

,,,,,,"Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning.","To respond to climate-related risks and opportunities, MinRes embeds climate risk analysis in our portfolio composition, emissions reductions, targets, technology and innovation developments. Guidance from our Climate Change Policy and stakeholder engagements progresses appropriate mitigation and management strategies. Company-level risks, such as the evolving mitigation regulations, are monitored by our Sustainability Committee and Audit and Risk Committee as well as our dedicated Decarbonisation Working Group. Once identified, risks are documented within our Group’s Enterprise Risk Register which includes mitigation and control measures. 

MinRes’ Sustainability Strategy is driven by a materiality assessment which identifies climate change as one of the highest business priorities.",,Climate Change Policy,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Describe the resilience of the organisation’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario.","As we continue to develop our management approach to climate change, we consider the resilience of our strategy under various scenarios to ensure that our business continues to generate and sustain value under a changing climate.

Our key climate-related risks and opportunities have been identified through the lens of three future scenarios. These scenarios described a combination of possible future physical and socioeconomic impacts to which we may be exposed:
• Scenario 1: ‘Orderly and Paris-aligned transition to a low-carbon economy’ is aligned with the Paris Agreement to keep global temperature increases below 2°C above pre-industrial average temperatures and is characterised by globally coordinated and government-led decarbonisation, where the worst physical impacts of climate change are avoided
• Scenario 2: ‘High GHG emissions with limited global coordination’ is aligned with global temperate increases of approximately 4°C above pre-industrial average temperatures and is characterised by business-as-usual conditions with limited and uncoordinated climate change regulation and activity
• Scenario 3: ‘Net-Zero Emissions by 2050’ is aligned with the most recent special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and is characterised by energy demand reductions, decarbonisation of electricity and other fuels, electrification of energy end use, stronger climate policy mitigation pathways consistent with high likelihood of carbon pricing imposed directly or implicitly by regulatory policies.

Our climate scenario analyses indicate the business’ long-term resilience and value generation under the three possible climate decarbonisation scenarios including a 1.5 - 2°C outcome.
