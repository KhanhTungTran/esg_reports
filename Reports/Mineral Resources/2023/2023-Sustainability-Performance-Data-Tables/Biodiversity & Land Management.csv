,,,,,,"MinRes recognises the nature of our operations has the potential to impact natural habitats and ecosystems in direct and indirect ways.  We work to ensure direct and indirect environmental impacts are avoided, minimised, rehabilitated and offset in alignment with the mitigation hierarchy. We are committed to responsible environmental management during all aspects of the mine lifecycle to protect the long-term health of the environments and communities where we operate.

Our biodiversity performance metrics are detailed below.",,,,,,,,,,
