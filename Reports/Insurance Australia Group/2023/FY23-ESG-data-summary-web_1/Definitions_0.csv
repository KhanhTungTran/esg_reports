9,,Air travel,"The distance travelled by air by IAG employees for work-related travel, reported through our travel service provider.","Categories for reporting emissions are broken down by travel class, and by domestic, international, and trans-Tasman flights. Air travel is measured as it is a material source of scope 3 carbon emissions and indicative of IAGÃ¢ÂÂs environmental impact.",305-3,13,Y,,
10,,Building refrigerants,Refrigerants are measured for the Australian region and are a source of our Scope 1 carbon emissions indicating IAGÃ¢ÂÂs environmental impact. It is disclosed in overall tonnes and kg per FTE (Full Time Employees).,"An inventory of synthetic gases stored in air conditioning and refrigeration equipment is undertaken at the third quarter of each financial year and reported on an annual basis. This determines the weight in kilograms (kg) of each type of synthetic gas (hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons) stored across the portfolio of air conditioning and refrigeration equipment in buildings under IAGÃ¢ÂÂs operational control. The following refrigerants are included in the calculation: R410A, R134A, R407C, R22, R32 and R410A. Refrigerants are measured only for the Australian region and are a source of our scope 1 carbon emissions that indicate IAGÃ¢ÂÂs environmental impact. \n\nTo determine the tCO2e, the following is calculated: Recharge capacity (kgs) x Annual leakage rate x Global Warming Potential (GWP) = GHG emissions from refrigerants (kgs CO2e)\n\nLeakage rate is applied and sourced from the Australian Government National Greenhouse Accounts Factors (NGAF, page 58) Global Warming Potential (GWP): is sourced from the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. Refrigerants are disclosed in overall tonnes and kg per FTE.",305-1,13,N,,
11,,Electricity,Metered electricity consumption and invoice data for sites directly owned or controlled by IAG.,"For sites where direct supplier data are not available, electricity consumption is estimated using an equivalent floor space model. Electricity usage is measured to indicate IAGÃ¢ÂÂs environmental impact and is a source of both scope 2 and scope 3 emissions (via transmission & distribution losses).\n\nFinal month or final quarter (dependent on the timing of billing) certain electricity usage data for certain sites are not available within reporting timeframes. Where data are not available, accrued values based on prior periods are used. \n\nElectricity usage is disclosed in Megawatt Hours (MWh) of electricity consumed and MWh used per FTE.",305-2,13,Y1,,
12,,Fuel usage,"Petrol, diesel, and ethanol consumed by IAG's tool of trade and salary packaged fleet of vehicles that are owned and operated by IAG. \nTool of trade: vehicles used by in-house assessors, for claims and sales purposes \nPackage vehicles: this scheme is based on a novated vehicle lease platform where the vehicle is financed and registered in the name of IAG rather than an employee's name for the duration of the agreement or until the Written Down Value (WDV) of the vehicle is paid for by the employee at the end of the agreement term.",Fuel usage is measured to indicate IAGÃ¢ÂÂs environmental impact and is a source of both scope 1 and scope 3 emissions (via transmission & distribution losses). Activity data for fuel consumption is obtained from fuel cards. No adjustments are made for any personal usage of the tool of trade vehicles.\nPackaged vehicle usage is currently only applicable to IAGÃ¢ÂÂs Australian business.\nFuel usage is disclosed in kilolitres (kL) of fuel consumed and kL fuel used per vehicle.,305-1,13,Y1,,
13,,General waste,"General waste means any non-hazardous waste for delivery to landfill that excludes recyclables separately collected from the sites, which does not go to landfill.","Various third-party contractors provide reporting on the tonnage of waste generated across the sites directly owned or controlled by IAG. For sites not included in the monthly waste reporting process, the waste tonnage for these sites is estimated using an equivalent FTE model. \nWaste to landfill is measured to indicate IAGÃ¢ÂÂs environmental impact and is a source of scope 3 emissions.\nGeneral waste is measured in overall tonnes of general waste per FTE.",305-3,13,N,,
14,,Natural gas usage,This includes metered natural gas consumption and bottled liquified petroleum gas (stationary LPG) usage for specific sites where IAG is directly billed.,"As only a limited number of sites within IAGÃ¢ÂÂs property portfolio use natural gas or bottled LPG, no additional extrapolations or estimates are undertaken. Gas usage is measured to indicate IAGÃ¢ÂÂs environmental impact and is a source of both scope 1 and scope 3 emissions (via transmission & distribution losses).\nNatural gas usage is disclosed in Gigajoules (GJ) of energy from natural gas or LPG consumed.",305-1,13,Y1,,
15,,Office paper consumption,"This includes all A3, A4 and A5 office paper and envelope consumption as determined through an in-house ordering system. This excludes glossy paper.","Office paper consumption is measured through supplier invoices for paper ordered during the month. This is measured as paper is one of the key resources that IAG uses that has an environmental impact through its production, manufacturing, and transportation, and contributes to IAGÃ¢ÂÂs scope 3 emissions. The majority of office paper that is supplied to IAG is certified by Climate Active as carbon neutral. This therefore does not factor into IAGÃ¢ÂÂs scope 3 emissions but is still included in overall usage figures.\nOffice paper consumption is disclosed in overall tonnes used and kg used per FTE.",305-1,13,N,,
16,,Print paper consumption,"This includes the consumption of commercially printed material (booklets, envelopes, brochures, and customer documentation such as renewals and certificates of insurance).","Print paper tonnage is provided from a range of external suppliers. The measurement of print paper is one of the key resources that IAG uses that has a considerable environmental impact through its production, manufacturing, and transportation, and contributes to IAGÃ¢ÂÂs scope 3 emissions, as purchased goods and services.",301-1,13,N,,
17,,Working from home,"Working from Home (WFH) captures the emissions related to household energy use (electricity and natural gas), for IAG employees whilst working from home.","The percentage of FTE that are WFH for any given period is sourced from door-access reports at each IAG location. The standard FTE hours per day are 7.5 hours. The calculation accounts for employees having 20 annual leave days per year.\nAustralia: The average household energy usage by state/territory from the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) is leveraged and calculated against the standard FTE workday. This is multiplied by the percentage of FTE working from home by state and territory, with state emissions factors then applied, sourced from the National Greenhouse Energy Register (NGER). \nNew Zealand: The emissions factor for staff WFH is sourced from the NZ Ministry of the Environment, determined using average electricity use, waste and wastewater use of NZ households.",301-1,13,Y,,
18,,Recycled waste,"Recycled waste is a measure of the quantity of waste diverted from landfill, including paper, cardboard, organic and co-mingled material collected for recycling across IAGÃ¢ÂÂs properties.","For sites where no actual co-mingled recycling data is available, the recycling quantity is estimated based on an equivalent FTE model using consumption figures for similar known sites. Cardboard and organic recycling is only available to IAGÃ¢ÂÂs larger sites, and hence not estimated across IAGÃ¢ÂÂs full property portfolio. Recycling is measured as an environmental indicator to how much waste is diverted from landfill, and hence scope 3 emissions averted.ÃÂ Recycled waste is measured in overall tonnes and kg of recycled waste produced per FTE.",306-2,13,N,,
19,,Onsite energy generation (solar),"IAG generates solar energy from two solar panel installations. One at our Burwood data centre in Victoria, Australia, which is owned by IAG. The other at the NZI centre in Auckland, New Zealand, which is landlord owned. The two solar installations have a combined capacity of approximately 200kW.","The total solar energy generated each period is captured through portals at both site. The solar energy generated supports the power needs of the onsite offices. Where excess energy is generated at the Burwood site, this is fed back to the grid for which IAG receives a feed in tariff at the local market rate. Energy generated is reported as megawatt hours, and supports our efforts to reduce our scope 2 emissions.",,13,N,,
20,,Rental car Ã¢ÂÂ business travel,This metric is only calculated for the Australia region and measures the kilometres travelled by IAG employees in rental cars for work-related travel.,"Booking reports are collected from our preferred third-party suppliers Ã¢ÂÂ Avis and Thrifty Ã¢ÂÂ and our travel management partner, Communico (Travel Edge). Rental car travel is measured as an indicator of IAGÃ¢ÂÂs environmental impact and is a source of scope 3 emissions. Rental car travel is disclosed as thousands of KMs, and as KMs per FTE",305-3,13,N,,
21,,Taxis Ã¢ÂÂ business travel,This metric measures the kilometres travelled and spend by IAG employees in taxis for work-related travel.,"For Australia: it represents distance travelled by employees taking taxis and other ride-sharing options for work-related travel. Distance travelled is not recorded for each journey, therefore an estimate of the distances travelled by IAG employees in taxis is calculated based on the dollar expenditure. All taxi travel expenditure is recorded in IAGÃ¢ÂÂs general ledger and this is then adjusted for the relevant flag-fall, GST and credit card surcharges, and converted to an estimated KMÃ¢ÂÂs using the distance charge rate per KM (State based). \nFor New Zealand: it represents $NZD spend by employees taking taxis and other ride-sharing options for work-related travel. The emissions are calculated based on the dollar expenditure recorded in IAGÃ¢ÂÂs general ledger , and then converted as per the factor provided by the NZ Ministry of the Environment Emissions Guide (2020). \nTaxi travel is measured as an indicator of IAGÃ¢ÂÂs environmental impact and is a source of scope 3 emissions. Taxi travel is disclosed as thousands of KMs (Australia), $NZD spend (New Zealand), and KMs per FTE.",305-3,13,N,,
