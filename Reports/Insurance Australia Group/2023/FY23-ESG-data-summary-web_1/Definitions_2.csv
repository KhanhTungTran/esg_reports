Journey claims and claims on an unpaid break are not included. Million hours worked includes all scheduled hours plus overtime, less leave and also includes the hours worked by casual employees. LTIFR may not be static year on year as prior period results may need to be retrospectively updated to reflect lost-time injuries that are substantiated post the original reporting date. Where this has occurred, we re-state prior period LTIFRs in our annual reporting. LTIFR is measured as in indicator for workplace safety and well-being.",403-9,8,Y,,
40,,Customer,,,,,,,
41,,Customer advocacy,Customer experience as measured by transactional net promoter score (tNPS) is an internal measure of customer advocacy based on experiences customers have had with us across all customer journeys. We obtain this information via surveys of our personal and business insurance customers who have had a recent interaction with IAG via assisted or digital channels. The tNPS figures as at June 2023 were calculated on a 12-month rolling average.,"The tNPS are the results of studies carried out by third parties among IAG customers (direct or intermediated) that ask customers their likelihood of recommending IAG on a scale of 0-10 in both Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThose who rate the experience as less than six (6), are deemed detractors whilst those who rate the experience nine (9) or ten (10) are deemed promoters or advocates. The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters/advocates. Passive scores (between seven (7) and eight (8)) are not accounted for in the methodology. The customer advocacy score is disclosed as it is indicative to IAGÃ¢ÂÂs impact on customers and how valuable their experience is with IAG.",,,Y,,

44,,Community investment,"This estimates direct financial support of community groups and programs through sponsorship and donations, as well as indirect support to help promote and raise awareness of these community organisations (including commitments) through promotion. Community investment also includes matched funding for employee workplace giving. \n\nWhere the purpose of the program is to create shared value (value for both the business and the community), investment spend has been apportioned to include only the portion that benefits the community, which is estimated based on consideration of program objectives. \n\nDirect IAG management and administration costs related to community investment are also included. In Australia and New Zealand, community investment also includes salary costs (calculated using base salary) and on-costs for employee volunteering hours recorded in the human resources systems.","To support the definition and classification of community investments, we are guided by the B4SI (Business for Societal Impact) Ã¢ÂÂ the global standard in measuring and managing corporate community investment. \nVolunteering time: This includes the equivalent financial cost of time volunteered by employees to various community initiatives. This will not include volunteering undertaken in personal time unless it is specifically acknowledged by the business. It also captures the time spent by employees engaged on the Jawun Secondment program. Volunteer costs are calculated by multiplying the average per hour salary of an average IAG employee by volunteer hours taken.\n\nManagement and Administration Costs: The management and administration costs of IAG employees directly involved in community investment. This includes salaries and on-costs, other staff expenses, consultants, printing & stationery, IT system expenses, motor vehicle expenses, postage & telephone external, and rent. To appropriately attribute the community-specific work of the staff, 1/3 of the Management costs of the sustainability-related team cost centres are included. We also include a % portion of marketing management costs, based on the amount of time their role is dedicated to promoting positive community outcomes (e.g. management of IAG's community partnerships and initiatives such as Habitat for Humanity New Zealand, South Australia State Emergency Services, and First Saturday of the Season). This is calculated by attributing a portion of the average marketing salary. \n\nCash Contributions: These comprise donations, sponsorships, employee engagement costs, community partnership fees and program costs attributable to community support.",201-1,,Y,,

47,,1 million actions target,The number of Australians and New Zealanders that have taken action to reduce their risk from natural hazards by FY25.,"This target is measured through actions that encourage either risk or emissions reduction. An action is counted when an individual takes a step to understand their risk or emissions, or understand options to reduce their risk or emissions, or implement or maintain an initiative to reduce their risk or emissions. This measure equates actions to individuals, as those in high risk areas will need to take multiple actions to reduce their risks from natural hazards. An example of an Australian\naction counted to date was the number of downloads of our co-created Get Prepared App with the Australian Red Cross. An example of a New Zealand action counted to date was the number of downloads of our Emergency Kit Checklist, included within our Wild Weather Tracker.",,13,N,,

49,,Normalised carbon footprint of equity investments,"Normalised carbon footprint is a measure of a portfolioÃ¢ÂÂs scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions that enables comparisons with a benchmark, between multiple portfolios, and over time, regardless of portfolio size.","Extracts from the equity portfolios are run through MSCI's ESG Manager research and analytics platform, which calculates the exposure of each listed equity based on MSCI research on ESG disclosures and other source data and aggregates this information based on the equityÃ¢ÂÂs portfolio weight. \n\nTo measure the normalised carbon footprint across listed equity investments, the total carbon footprint of each equity is combined and then expressed in terms of tCO2e per US$ million invested by IAG.",,13,Y,,
50,,Weighted average carbon intensity of equity investments,"Since companies with higher carbon intensity are likely to face more exposure to carbon related market and regulatory risks, this metric indicates a portfolioÃ¢ÂÂs exposure to potential climate change-related risks relative to other portfolios or a benchmark. Agnostic to ownership share and portfolio size, it also facilitates comparison with non-equity asset classes.","Extracts from the equity portfolios are run through MSCI's ESG Manager research and analytics platform, which calculates the exposure of each listed equity based on MSCI research on ESG disclosures and other source data and aggregates this information based on the equityÃ¢ÂÂs portfolio weight. \n\nTo measure the weighted average carbon intensity across listed equity investments, the weighted carbon intensity of each issuer is expressed as tCO2e per US$ million sales.",,13,Y,,
