,Air travel,"The distance travelled by air by IAG employees for work-related travel, reported through our travel service provider.","Categories for reporting emissions are broken down by travel class, and by domestic, international, and trans-Tasman flights. Air travel is measured as it is a material source of scope 3 carbon emissions and indicative of IAG’s environmental impact.",305-3,13,Y,,
,Building refrigerants,Refrigerants are measured for the Australian region and are a source of our Scope 1 carbon emissions indicating IAG’s environmental impact. It is disclosed in overall tonnes and kg per FTE (Full Time Employees). ,"An inventory of synthetic gases stored in air conditioning and refrigeration equipment is undertaken at the third quarter of each financial year and reported on an annual basis. This determines the weight in kilograms (kg) of each type of synthetic gas (hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons) stored across the portfolio of air conditioning and refrigeration equipment in buildings under IAG’s operational control. The following refrigerants are included in the calculation: R410A, R134A, R407C, R22, R32 and R410A. Refrigerants are measured only for the Australian region and are a source of our scope 1 carbon emissions that indicate IAG’s environmental impact. 

To determine the tCO2e, the following is calculated: Recharge capacity (kgs) x Annual leakage rate x Global Warming Potential (GWP) = GHG emissions from refrigerants (kgs CO2e)

Leakage rate is applied and sourced from the Australian Government National Greenhouse Accounts Factors (NGAF, page 58) Global Warming Potential (GWP): is sourced from the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. Refrigerants are disclosed in overall tonnes and kg per FTE.",305-1,13,N,,
,Electricity,Metered electricity consumption and invoice data for sites directly owned or controlled by IAG.,"For sites where direct supplier data are not available, electricity consumption is estimated using an equivalent floor space model. Electricity usage is measured to indicate IAG’s environmental impact and is a source of both scope 2 and scope 3 emissions (via transmission & distribution losses).

Final month or final quarter (dependent on the timing of billing) certain electricity usage data for certain sites are not available within reporting timeframes. Where data are not available, accrued values based on prior periods are used. 

Electricity usage is disclosed in Megawatt Hours (MWh) of electricity consumed and MWh used per FTE.",305-2,13,Y1,,
,Fuel usage,"Petrol, diesel, and ethanol consumed by IAG's tool of trade and salary packaged fleet of vehicles that are owned and operated by IAG. 
Tool of trade: vehicles used by in-house assessors, for claims and sales purposes 
Package vehicles: this scheme is based on a novated vehicle lease platform where the vehicle is financed and registered in the name of IAG rather than an employee's name for the duration of the agreement or until the Written Down Value (WDV) of the vehicle is paid for by the employee at the end of the agreement term. ","Fuel usage is measured to indicate IAG’s environmental impact and is a source of both scope 1 and scope 3 emissions (via transmission & distribution losses). Activity data for fuel consumption is obtained from fuel cards. No adjustments are made for any personal usage of the tool of trade vehicles.
Packaged vehicle usage is currently only applicable to IAG’s Australian business.
Fuel usage is disclosed in kilolitres (kL) of fuel consumed and kL fuel used per vehicle.",305-1,13,Y1,,
,General waste,"General waste means any non-hazardous waste for delivery to landfill that excludes recyclables separately collected from the sites, which does not go to landfill.","Various third-party contractors provide reporting on the tonnage of waste generated across the sites directly owned or controlled by IAG. For sites not included in the monthly waste reporting process, the waste tonnage for these sites is estimated using an equivalent FTE model. 
Waste to landfill is measured to indicate IAG’s environmental impact and is a source of scope 3 emissions.
General waste is measured in overall tonnes of general waste per FTE.",305-3,13,N,,
,Natural gas usage,This includes metered natural gas consumption and bottled liquified petroleum gas (stationary LPG) usage for specific sites where IAG is directly billed.,"As only a limited number of sites within IAG’s property portfolio use natural gas or bottled LPG, no additional extrapolations or estimates are undertaken. Gas usage is measured to indicate IAG’s environmental impact and is a source of both scope 1 and scope 3 emissions (via transmission & distribution losses).
Natural gas usage is disclosed in Gigajoules (GJ) of energy from natural gas or LPG consumed.",305-1,13,Y1,,
,Office paper consumption,"This includes all A3, A4 and A5 office paper and envelope consumption as determined through an in-house ordering system. This excludes glossy paper.  ","Office paper consumption is measured through supplier invoices for paper ordered during the month. This is measured as paper is one of the key resources that IAG uses that has an environmental impact through its production, manufacturing, and transportation, and contributes to IAG’s scope 3 emissions. The majority of office paper that is supplied to IAG is certified by Climate Active as carbon neutral. This therefore does not factor into IAG’s scope 3 emissions but is still included in overall usage figures.
Office paper consumption is disclosed in overall tonnes used and kg used per FTE.",305-1,13,N,,
,Print paper consumption,"This includes the consumption of commercially printed material (booklets, envelopes, brochures, and customer documentation such as renewals and certificates of insurance).","Print paper tonnage is provided from a range of external suppliers. The measurement of print paper is one of the key resources that IAG uses that has a considerable environmental impact through its production, manufacturing, and transportation, and contributes to IAG’s scope 3 emissions, as purchased goods and services.",301-1,13,N,,
,Working from home,"Working from Home (WFH) captures the emissions related to household energy use (electricity and natural gas), for IAG employees whilst working from home.","The percentage of FTE that are WFH for any given period is sourced from door-access reports at each IAG location. The standard FTE hours per day are 7.5 hours. The calculation accounts for employees having 20 annual leave days per year.
Australia: The average household energy usage by state/territory from the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) is leveraged and calculated against the standard FTE workday. This is multiplied by the percentage of FTE working from home by state and territory, with state emissions factors then applied, sourced from the National Greenhouse Energy Register (NGER). 
New Zealand: The emissions factor for staff WFH is sourced from the NZ Ministry of the Environment, determined using average electricity use, waste and wastewater use of NZ households. ",301-1,13,Y,,
,Recycled waste,"Recycled waste is a measure of the quantity of waste diverted from landfill, including paper, cardboard, organic and co-mingled material collected for recycling across IAG’s properties. ","For sites where no actual co-mingled recycling data is available, the recycling quantity is estimated based on an equivalent FTE model using consumption figures for similar known sites. Cardboard and organic recycling is only available to IAG’s larger sites, and hence not estimated across IAG’s full property portfolio. Recycling is measured as an environmental indicator to how much waste is diverted from landfill, and hence scope 3 emissions averted. Recycled waste is measured in overall tonnes and kg of recycled waste produced per FTE. ",306-2,13,N,,
,Onsite energy generation (solar),"IAG generates solar energy from two solar panel installations. One at our Burwood data centre in Victoria, Australia, which is owned by IAG. The other at the NZI centre in Auckland, New Zealand, which is landlord owned. The two solar installations have a combined capacity of approximately 200kW.","The total solar energy generated each period is captured through portals at both site. The solar energy generated supports the power needs of the onsite offices. Where excess energy is generated at the Burwood site, this is fed back to the grid for which IAG receives a feed in tariff at the local market rate. Energy generated is reported as megawatt hours, and supports our efforts to reduce our scope 2 emissions.",,13,N,,
,Rental car – business travel,This metric is only calculated for the Australia region and measures the kilometres travelled by IAG employees in rental cars for work-related travel. ,"Booking reports are collected from our preferred third-party suppliers – Avis and Thrifty – and our travel management partner, Communico (Travel Edge). Rental car travel is measured as an indicator of IAG’s environmental impact and is a source of scope 3 emissions. Rental car travel is disclosed as thousands of KMs, and as KMs per FTE",305-3,13,N,,
,Taxis – business travel,This metric measures the kilometres travelled and spend by IAG employees in taxis for work-related travel. ,"For Australia: it represents distance travelled by employees taking taxis and other ride-sharing options for work-related travel. Distance travelled is not recorded for each journey, therefore an estimate of the distances travelled by IAG employees in taxis is calculated based on the dollar expenditure. All taxi travel expenditure is recorded in IAG’s general ledger and this is then adjusted for the relevant flag-fall, GST and credit card surcharges, and converted to an estimated KM’s using the distance charge rate per KM (State based). 
For New Zealand: it represents $NZD spend by employees taking taxis and other ride-sharing options for work-related travel. The emissions are calculated based on the dollar expenditure recorded in IAG’s general ledger , and then converted as per the factor provided by the NZ Ministry of the Environment Emissions Guide (2020).  
Taxi travel is measured as an indicator of IAG’s environmental impact and is a source of scope 3 emissions. Taxi travel is disclosed as thousands of KMs (Australia), $NZD spend (New Zealand), and KMs per FTE.",305-3,13,N,,
,Water (kL),"Water is reported for our Australian property portfolio only, this metric represents total water consumption for our tenancies. ","Where actual data is unavailable, water consumption is extrapolated based on an equivalent FTE model. Water consumption is measured as an indicator of IAG’s environmental impact. Water consumption is measured in overall kilolitres (kL) and kL water used per FTE. ",303-5,6,N,,
,Carbon offsets,Each year IAG purchases carbon offsets for the year ahead in order to remain carbon neutral on scope 1 and 2 emissions and measured scope 3 emissions sources that are within the boundary of our reporting.,"The following steps are taken to purchase and retire carbon offsets. A carbon inventory is maintained providing a summary of previous year purchases and retirement details. 
- Purchase of like-for-like offsets is completed before financial year end, based on inventory levels, market opportunity and forecasted emissions.
- The offsets purchased will meet existing public guidance e.g. Climate Active, and be retired at or before the time of making a carbon neutral claim.
- If internal carbon units are purchased e.g. Verified Carbon Units and Verified Carbon Standard, a tracking table is provided with inventory and retirement details.
- If Australian Carbon Units are purchased, an IAG owned public registry is used to manage inventory and retirement details.
- Carbon offsets are retired at time of purchase, and IAG tracks requirement following confirmation of total emissions for the financial year.",,13,Y,,
,Conversion factors for CO2e calculations,IAG’s carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2e) are a key performance indicator to how IAG is managing its environmental impact. CO2e factors for the relevant environmental indicators are obtained from a number of sources.,"CO2e factors

,Absenteeism,Indicates the employee absence level at IAG. ,"Absenteeism is determined by dividing the total annual unscheduled absence days (such as all types of sick leave and personal emergency leave) by the total number of available (rostered) working days for all employees in the year. Absenteeism is calculated for full and part-time staff, staff on fixed-term contracts and staff who are on extended leave. Guests, casuals, and contractors are not included. Absenteeism is measured as an indicator that links to overall employee satisfaction, safety, and productivity.",403-9,8,Y,,
,Age grouping,Percentage of IAG's workforce in each age bracket,"Includes the following breakdown:
·       Under 30 years old
·       30-50 years old
·       Over 50 years old",405-1,8,Y,,
,Full time equivalent (FTE),"FTE indicates the size of IAG's workforce that takes into account part-time employees where full-time employees are given a value of one. FTE’s work 37.5 hours per week, and there is also a category of workers (from grandfathered roles) who are classified as Full Time if they work 35 hours per week. ","The value for part-time employees is based on their regular hours as a proportion of full-time hours. The FTE includes all permanent full-time (including executives) and part-time employees, employees on a fixed term contract (paid by an IAG Group company’s payroll), and employees on leave without pay (less than 28 calendar days). It excludes guests (not paid by IAG), casuals and employees on extended leave without pay (more than 28 calendar days) on the day data is reported.",102-7,8,Y,,
,Part-time employees ,The percentage of full-time versus part-time employees included in IAG’s headcount.,"Full-time employees work 35 or 37.5hours per week depending on their Enterprise Agreement or contract, while part-time employees work fewer weekly hours than full-time. This calculation excludes temporary employees. Full-time versus part-time employee percentages are measured as a potential social indicator of fair work and underemployment.",102-8,,Y,,
,First Nations employment,The First Nations employment percentage represents the number of people in the Australian workforce that identify as an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander person. ,The total number of people that identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is divided by the total Australian headcount. The data are based on the same population as those included in Total Headcount. ,405-1,10.2,Y,,
,Headcount,"The overall number of people employed by IAG, regardless of hours worked.","Headcount comprises permanent and fixed term employees. It includes employees on extended leave and excludes casuals, contractors, and guests (people not paid by IAG).",102-7,,Y,,
,Male to female salary ratio,The ratio is determined by dividing mean annual Total Fixed Remuneration (TFR) base salary for all males by that for all females within each employment category.,"TFR salary is used to standardise all salaries to what would be earned if each employee worked full time. This is obtained by multiplying the base salary by a factor (standard full-time hours by region/actual weekly hours). This is measured as an indicator for workplace diversity and equity of opportunity across genders. 
Employment categories disclosed represent the following employment levels:
- Heads Of / General Manager – direct reports of IAG’s Group Executive members. 
- Senior Management – direct reports to IAG’s Head of / General Manager group, within three reporting steps of the CEO (consistent with the definition of senior management for the Women in Senior Management percentage). 
- Manager / senior specialists – direct reports to IAG’s senior manager group, or those only in that band.
- General employees – all other employees.
Note that the Australian and New Zealand CEOs and Group Executives are not included as a salary group for the purposes of reporting on remuneration ratios as their variations and small population skew the data.
The group male: female annual salary ratio is weighted to better allow for exchange rate and salary level differences between Australia and New Zealand. ",405-2,8,Y,,
,Gender pay gap,The gender pay gap between men and women. Includes fixed pay only. Disclosed percentage is for the New Zealand workforce.,"Average gender pay gap is calculated as follows:
- (average female fixed pay – average male fixed pay) / average male fixed pay",405-2,8,Y,,
,Staff turnover,"Total turnover indicates the total number of staff terminations as a percentage of headcount, shown as a rolling 12-month figure.","Staff terminations include all permanent and fixed term full-time and part-time employees but exclude casual employees and guests, where the last day of employment was within the reporting period. Terminations do not include: non-starters, people terminated at the end of a fixed term, deceased, transferred, and work permit expired. Terminations do include fixed term appointments that are terminated earlier than the contract expiry date. Turnover is measured as an indicator that links to overall employee satisfaction and productivity.",401-1,8,Y,,
,Women on the Board,This measures the total percentage of women on the Insurance Australia Group Limited Board.,"Total number of female Board members divided by the total number of Board members, for the Insurance Australia Group Limited Board.",405-1,"5, 8",Y,,
,Women in senior management,"This measures the total percentage of women in Senior Management, which includes Group Executives, Executive (Heads of) General Managers and the people who report directly to them.","This criteria for senior management are restricted to roles that are applied to a specific career band, and within three reporting steps from the group CEO (i.e. generally at the Executive Manager level and above). Applying this definition helps align IAG to the philosophy and intent of the WGEA reporting. The figure of women in senior management is then expressed as a percentage of the total number of staff in senior management positions. ",,"5, 8",Y,,
,Women in executive management,This measures the percentage of women on the IAG Group Leadership Team (GLT). ,"Total number of female Executives divided by the total number of Executives, across the IAG Group.",,"5, 8",Y,,
,Women in the workforce,"Total percentage of females employed by IAG, regardless of hours worked.",This comprises permanent and fixed term female employees. It includes female employees on extended leave and excludes female casuals and contractors (people not paid by IAG). This is measured as an indicator for workplace diversity.,,"5, 8",Y,,
,Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR),The number of lost time injuries for each one million hours worked.,"A lost time injury is an injury that has resulted in at least one shift/day's absence from work and for which a workers' compensation claim has been lodged and liability accepted. Journey claims and claims on an unpaid break are not included. Million hours worked includes all scheduled hours plus overtime, less leave and also includes the hours worked by casual employees. LTIFR may not be static year on year as prior period results may need to be retrospectively updated to reflect lost-time injuries that are substantiated post the original reporting date.  Where this has occurred, we re-state prior period LTIFRs in our annual reporting. LTIFR is measured as in indicator for workplace safety and well-being.",403-9,8,Y,,
,Customer,,,,,,,
,Customer advocacy,Customer experience as measured by transactional net promoter score (tNPS) is an internal measure of customer advocacy based on experiences customers have had with us across all customer journeys. We obtain this information via surveys of our personal and business insurance customers who have had a recent interaction with IAG via assisted or digital channels. The tNPS figures as at June 2023 were calculated on a 12-month rolling average.,"The tNPS are the results of studies carried out by third parties among IAG customers (direct or intermediated) that ask customers their likelihood of recommending IAG on a scale of 0-10 in both Australia and New Zealand.

Those who rate the experience as less than six (6), are deemed detractors whilst those who rate the experience nine (9) or ten (10) are deemed promoters or advocates. The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters/advocates. Passive scores (between seven (7) and eight (8)) are not accounted for in the methodology. The customer advocacy score is disclosed as it is indicative to IAG’s impact on customers and how valuable their experience is with IAG. ",,,Y,,
,Customer complaints  ,This metric is defined by Australian Financial Complaints Authority Regulatory Guide 271 (AFCA RG271).,"The ‘percentage of Customer Complaints resolved within 30 days’ metric relates to all customers insured with any of the Australian brands listed below, and the 30 days’ time period starts when the complaint is received from the customer and ends when a decision is made and Internal Dispute Resolution (IDR) is considered as resolved. 
Brands in-scope: CGU, RACV, Coles, Rollin’ Insurance, SGIC, Insurance 4 That, SGIO, Lumley Special Vehicles, Sharecover, Motor Trade Direct, SUU, NRMA Insurance , Swann Insurance, WFI. 
Currently only disclosed for the Australian business.",,,Y,,
,Community,,,,,,,
,Community investment,"This estimates direct financial support of community groups and programs through sponsorship and donations, as well as indirect support to help promote and raise awareness of these community organisations (including commitments) through promotion. Community investment also includes matched funding for employee workplace giving.  

Where the purpose of the program is to create shared value (value for both the business and the community), investment spend has been apportioned to include only the portion that benefits the community, which is estimated based on consideration of program objectives. 

Direct IAG management and administration costs related to community investment are also included. In Australia and New Zealand, community investment also includes salary costs (calculated using base salary) and on-costs for employee volunteering hours recorded in the human resources systems. ","To support the definition and classification of community investments, we are guided by the B4SI (Business for Societal Impact) – the global standard in measuring and managing corporate community investment. 
Volunteering time: This includes the equivalent financial cost of time volunteered by employees to various community initiatives. This will not include volunteering undertaken in personal time unless it is specifically acknowledged by the business. It also captures the time spent by employees engaged on the Jawun Secondment program. Volunteer costs are calculated by multiplying the average per hour salary of an average IAG employee by volunteer hours taken.

Management and Administration Costs: The management and administration costs of IAG employees directly involved in community investment. This includes salaries and on-costs, other staff expenses, consultants, printing & stationery, IT system expenses, motor vehicle expenses, postage & telephone external, and rent. To appropriately attribute the community-specific work of the staff, 1/3 of the Management costs of the sustainability-related team cost centres are included. We also include a % portion of marketing management costs, based on the amount of time their role is dedicated to promoting positive community outcomes (e.g. management of IAG's community partnerships and initiatives such as Habitat for Humanity New Zealand, South Australia State Emergency Services, and First Saturday of the Season). This is calculated by attributing a portion of the average marketing salary. 

Cash Contributions: These comprise donations, sponsorships, employee engagement costs, community partnership fees and program costs attributable to community support. ",201-1,,Y,,
,Indigenous supplier spend,"Annual spend with Supply Nation certified/registered suppliers, and those that are certified/registered with state based Indigenous Chamber of Commerce bodies and/or Trading Blak. Total spend since the initiation of our Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan in June 2022 is also reported. ",The ABNs for all the suppliers on our database are mapped with Supply Nation’s approved suppliers listing. The spend of Indigenous tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers is tracked and reported.,,,Y,,
,Number of Indigenous suppliers,"The number of Supply Nation certified/registered suppliers, and those that are certified/registered with state based Indigenous Chamber of Commerce bodies and/or Trading Blak, in our supply chain (tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers).",The ABNs for all the suppliers on our database are mapped with Supply Nation’s approved suppliers listing. The number of Indigenous tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers is tracked and reported.,,,Y,,
,1 million actions target,The number of Australians and New Zealanders that have taken action to reduce their risk from natural hazards by FY25.,"This target is measured through actions that encourage either risk or emissions reduction. An action is counted when an individual takes a step to understand their risk or emissions, or understand options to reduce their risk or emissions, or implement or maintain an initiative to reduce their risk or emissions. This measure equates actions to individuals, as those in high risk areas will need to take multiple actions to reduce their risks from natural hazards. An example of an Australian
action counted to date was the number of downloads of our co-created Get Prepared App with the Australian Red Cross. An example of a New Zealand action counted to date was the number of downloads of our Emergency Kit Checklist, included within our Wild Weather Tracker. ",,13,N,,
,Climate performance,,,,,,,
,Normalised carbon footprint of equity investments,"Normalised carbon footprint is a measure of a portfolio’s scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions that enables comparisons with a benchmark, between multiple portfolios, and over time, regardless of portfolio size. ","Extracts from the equity portfolios are run through MSCI's ESG Manager research and analytics platform, which calculates the exposure of each listed equity based on MSCI research on ESG disclosures and other source data and aggregates this information based on the equity’s portfolio weight. 

To measure the normalised carbon footprint across listed equity investments, the total carbon footprint of each equity is combined and then expressed in terms of tCO2e per US$ million invested by IAG.",,13,Y,,
,Weighted average carbon intensity of equity investments,"Since companies with higher carbon intensity are likely to face more exposure to carbon related market and regulatory risks, this metric indicates a portfolio’s exposure to potential climate change-related risks relative to other portfolios or a benchmark. Agnostic to ownership share and portfolio size, it also facilitates comparison with non-equity asset classes.","Extracts from the equity portfolios are run through MSCI's ESG Manager research and analytics platform, which calculates the exposure of each listed equity based on MSCI research on ESG disclosures and other source data and aggregates this information based on the equity’s portfolio weight. 

To measure the weighted average carbon intensity across listed equity investments, the weighted carbon intensity of each issuer is expressed as tCO2e per US$ million sales.",,13,Y,,
,Commercial underwriting portfolio exposure at Jun 30 2023 to fossil fuel mining and fossil fuel energy generating activities,"IAG had a target to cease underwriting entities predominantly in the business of extracting fossil fuels and power generation from fossil fuels, by the end
of FY23. When defining business underwriting exposure to fossil fuels our key parameters are:
- Fossil fuel extraction – including the mining of any hydrocarbon fuels where extraction makes up over 30% of all the entity’s activities
- Power generation using fossil fuels – where thermal coal makes up over 30% of the electricity generated.","Application of these parameters does not include:
- Policies and/or portfolios that IAG has divested from where the liability for future claims will exist until expiry of the policy
- Workers’ compensation, irrespective of the climate intensity/fossil fuel exposure of the industry they work in. Everyone needs to be protected at work
- Supporting businesses that supply, transport or provide distribution services to these entities 
- Small and medium size enterprises with turnover less than $100 million, where the primary industry classification of the business is not related to mining or power generation, however more than 30% of their turnover may be generated through engagement in these industries.",,13,Y,,
,Green bonds,Green bonds are fixed-income securities in which the proceeds will be exclusively and formally applied to projects or activities that promote climate or other environmental sustainability purposes and initiatives through their use of proceeds. The term “green bond” can also refer to “climate bonds” or “sustainable bonds.” ,Green bonds are valued at mark-to-market in line with other fixed income financial instruments in IAG's investment portfolio. The bond criteria are cross checked to Bloomberg issuance descriptions. Green bond issuers make publicly available information about their programs as well as independent verification of their issuances. ,,13,Y,,
,Underwriting portfolio target,Underwriting portfolio exposure to entities predominantly in the business of extracting fossil fuels and power generation from fossil fuels.,"When defining business underwriting exposure to fossil fuels our key parameters are:
- Fossil fuel extraction – including the mining of any hydrocarbon fuels where extraction makes up over 30% of all the entity’s activities
- Power generation using fossil fuels – where thermal coal makes up over 30% of the electricity generated.

Application of these parameters does not include:
- Policies and/or portfolios that IAG has divested from where the liability for future claims will exist until expiry of the policy
- Workers’ compensation, irrespective of the climate intensity/fossil fuel exposure of the industry they work in as everyone needs to be protected at work
- Supporting businesses that supply, transport or provide distribution services to these entities
- Small and medium size enterprises with turnover less than $100 million, where the primary industry classification of the business is not related to mining or power generation, however more than 30% of their turnover may be generated through engagement in these industries.

Exposure to fossil fuel related activities by IAG’s business underwriting is determined by shortlisting the relevant fossil fuel related Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) codes against IAG's insurance portfolios. Key word and key entity searches are also conducted to check for exposures not captured by the ANZSIC codes list. ",,13,Y,,
