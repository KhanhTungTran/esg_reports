,"4. Scope 3: indirect emissions that occur upstream and downstream of our business. IAG includes the following scope 3 emission sources within the boundary of reporting: business travel, waste to landfill, paper, staff working from home, and  transmission & distribution (T&D) losses (which includes T&D losses from electricity, natural gas, stationary LPG, and company vehicle fuel sources).
