This includes salaries and on-costs, other staff expenses, consultants, printing &amp; stationery, IT system expenses, motor vehicle expenses, postage &amp; telephone external, and rent. To appropriately attribute the community-specific work of the staff, 1/3 of the Management costs of the sustainability-related team cost centres are included.
