Details of our performance is available in the 2023 ESG Supplement and the 2023 Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nClimate stability (Environmental sustainability)\n\nWe were the first Australian bank to join the NZBA in 2021. That same year, we set 2030 targets for carbon intensive sectors for large-scale commercial real estate in Australia and global power generation. In 2022, we set additional 2030 targets for carbon intensive sectors for oil and gas and building materials: cement, aluminium and steel. This year, we added new targets for thermal coal and three transport sub-sectors Ã¢ÂÂ auto-manufacturing, airlines, and shipping. We aim to progressively expand our coverage of key sectors up to the end 2024, in line with our NZBA commitment and the evolution of globally recognised standards and methodologies.\n\nOur sectoral decarbonisation targets sit alongside additional targets. \nIn 2023 ANZ concluded its $50 billion by 2025 sustainable solutions target having funded and facilitated close to $47 billion and were forecast to meet our $50 billion target well in advance of 2025. Therefore we set a new target to fund and facilitate at least $100 billion by end 2030, including A$15 billion by end 2024, in social and environmental outcomes through customers activities and direct investment by ANZ. This includes initiatives that help lower carbon emissions, protect nature and biodiversity, increase access to affordable housing and promote financial wellbeing. Since April 2023 we have participated in 54 transactions and funding/facilitating ~$8.8 billion towards the target. \n\nAnother ESG target is to enhance our management of climate risks and opportunities by intensifying our engagement with our largest emitting business customers. We will expect and encourage them to strengthen their low carbon transition plans, by: \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ focusing our engagement and raised expectations on our 100 largest emitting customers with the aim that by end 2025, compared to their starting point more customers achieve a Ã¢ÂÂwell developedÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂadvancedÃ¢ÂÂ rating for their low carbon transition plans; and\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ extending the use of our Climate Change Risk Assessment methodology so that by end 2024 it has been used to support our engagement with the revised list of our 100 largest emitting customers.\n\nWe also have targets to reduce our operational footprint focused on carbon emissions, renewable electricity, water and paper consumption, and waste, all of which are on track.\n\nDetailed information about how we operationalise these targets can be found in the 2023 Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Information regarding how we calculate and monitor the NZBA targets is available in the Financed Emissions Methodology available at anz.com/esgreport.\n\nAvailability, accessibility, affordability, quality of resources & services (Housing) \n\nThis year marked the halfway point for performance against our target to fund and facilitate A$10 billion of investment by 2030 to deliver more affordable, accessible and sustainable homes to buy and rent in Australia and New Zealand. Since OCtober 2018 we have funded and facilitated over A$5 billion towards this target, with over A$600 million of investment in FY23. \n\nIn FY23, ANZ continued to support New Zealanders looking to combat rising energy and fuel costs and improve the environmental sustainability of their homes, encouraging better housing standards for both owner occupiers and renters through our Healthy Home Loan package and Good Energy Home Loan. \n\nSince October 2020 we have supported 9,482 households into healthier homes and drawn down $379.09m",,2023 ESG Supplement (pages 15-20),,,

Beyond providing core banking services, we play a key role in leading research into what is influencing financial wellbeing in Australia and New Zealand. Insights from our research are shared publicly so they can be used by government, community and corporate sectors to inform their work, and we use these insights to inform our products and services, as well as our financial education programs, Saver Plus and MoneyMinded. These programs involve close collaboration with partners from the community and government sectors. \n\nIn FY23, we achieved our previous two targets:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 36% of ANZ Plus customers have created a savings goal (against a target of 30% or more)\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ We have established 14 new MoneyMinded partnerships since October 2020 (against a target of seven). These partnerships have enabled us to deliver MoneyMinded to more lower income people across the markets we operate in to help improve their financial wellbeing. \n\nThis year, we developed two new targets for FY24:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Encourage our customers to build and maintain financial resilience with the aim of having at least 2.5 million customers (From a baseline of approximately 2.4 million customers as at 30/09/2023) with a financial buffer of approximately 6 weeksÃ¢ÂÂ expenses by end 2026. (Australia/New Zealand) \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Pilot a savings program (Saver Plus) for people on lower incomes in Fiji and Vanuatu by end 2025, with at least 80% of participants having demonstrated a savings habit (2. 8 out of 10 months saving (as per Saver Plus program), measured by participant survey data) upon completion (Pacific). \n\nMore information on all our ESG targets and performance can be found on pages 15-20 of the 2023 ESG Supplement and pages 81-82 of the 2023 Climate-related Financial Disclosures.",,,,,
