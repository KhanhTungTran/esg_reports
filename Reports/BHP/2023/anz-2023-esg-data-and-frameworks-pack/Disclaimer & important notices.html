When used in the pack, the words âforecastâ, âestimateâ, âtargetâ âintendâ, âbelieveâ, âexpectâ, âwillâ, âseekâ, âwouldâ and similar expressions, as they relate to ANZ and its management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements or opinions. Those statements are usually predictive in character; or may be affected by inaccurate assumptions or unknown risks and uncertainties or may differ materially from results ultimately achieved. As such, these statements should not be relied upon when making investment decisions.

      <td>CLIMATE-RELATED INFORMATION \n\nThis data and frameworks may contain climate-related statements, including in relation to climate-related risks and opportunities, climate-related goals and ambitions, climate scenarios, emissions reduction pathways and climate projections. While ANZ has prepared the statements in good faith, climate-related statements are subject to significant uncertainty, challenges and risks that may affect their usefulness, accuracy and completeness, including:\n\n1.\tAvailability and reliability of data â emissions and climate-related data may be incomplete, inconsistent, unreliable or unavailable (including information from ANZâs clients), and it may be necessary to rely on assumptions, estimates or proxies where that is the case.\n\n2.\tUncertain methodologies and modelling â methodologies, frameworks and standards used for calculations of climate-related metrics, modelling and climate data are not universally applied, are rapidly evolving and subject to change. This may impact the data modelling, approaches, and targets used in preparation of this pack. \n\n3.\tComplexity of calculations and estimates â Estimating financed emissions (including allocating emissions to financing activities) and emissions reduction is complex and relies on assumptions and judgments, often made in respect of long periods of time. For facilitated emissions, suitable standards to allow financial institutions to calculate facilitated emissions are still under development as at October 2023. \n\n4.\tChanges to climate-related governing frameworks â changes to climate-related policy, laws, regulations and market practices, standards and developments, including those resulting from legal proceedings and regulatory investigations.\n\n5.\tLack of consistency in definitions and climate-science terminology subject to changes â definitions and standards for climate-related data and assessment frameworks used across industries and jurisdictions may vary, and terminology and concepts relating to climate science and decarbonisation pathways may evolve and change over time. These inconsistencies and changes can also make comparisons between different organisationsâ climate targets and achievements difficult or inappropriate. \n\n6.\tReliance on third parties for data or involvement â ANZ may need to rely on assistance, data or other information from external data and methodology providers or other third parties, which may also be subject to change and uncertainty. Additionally, action and continuing participation of third parties, such as stakeholders, may be required (including financial institutions and governmental and non-governmental organisations).</td>
