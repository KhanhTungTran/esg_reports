,Definition of local,Qualitative description,204-1 (b),"‘Local’ suppliers are identified as suppliers with a local postcode, which is indicative of the supplier having a local office. Note: a supplier will therefore be counted as a ‘local supplier’ if it is part of a larger organisation with a local office. Conversely, even if a supplier has local employees, it will not be “local” if its address is not a local address in our system.",,,,
