5,,Definition of local,Qualitative description,204-1 (b),"Ã¢ÂÂLocalÃ¢ÂÂ suppliers are identified as suppliers with a local postcode, which is indicative of the supplier having a local office. Note: a supplier will therefore be counted as a Ã¢ÂÂlocal supplierÃ¢ÂÂ if it is part of a larger organisation with a local office. Conversely, even if a supplier has local employees, it will not be Ã¢ÂÂlocalÃ¢ÂÂ if its address is not a local address in our system.",,,,
