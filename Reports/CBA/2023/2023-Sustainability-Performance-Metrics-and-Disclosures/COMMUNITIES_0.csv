22,1 FY23 includes a broader range of meaningful support provided to participants by the Financial Independence Hub. Prior years have been restated to ensure comparable year-on-year data. Not assured by PwC.,,,,,,,,
23,"2 In FY22, 72 interactions covering outbound contacts made for the purpose of supporting customers in receipt of potentially abusive transaction descriptions were also included. This channel was excluded in FY23 due to a change in information handling. Of the total 20,560 interactions, 16,260 were assured by PwC. 875 internal vulnerability referrals received by the Community Wellbeing team were also excluded from the limited assurance engagement due to a change in information handling. 3,425 interactions related to the asynchronous chat channel, were unable to be assured due to the nature of the third party data that was able to be provided as part of the assurance.",,,,,,,,
24,"3 The 'Providing banking services to First Nations customers' e-learning was completed and launched in the second half of FY22 and is mandatory for targeted teams in the retail and business banks and is recommended for all other employees. The roll out of this mandatory learning drove the increase between FY21 to FY22. As employees are not expected to complete this training every year, the overall training completion rate is lower in FY23.",,,,,,,,
