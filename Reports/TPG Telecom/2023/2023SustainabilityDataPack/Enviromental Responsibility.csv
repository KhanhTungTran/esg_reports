,Notes:,,,,,
,"3 - Our targets have been set in-line with the Science Based Target Initiative requirements. This includes the following coverage and temperature scenarios:
   - Near-term targets: 100% of Scope 1 & 2 emissions sources, aligned with the 1.5°C scenario and 67% of Scope 3 sources, aligned with the well-below 2°C scenario. 
     Scope 3 sources include the categories of purchased goods and services, use of sold products, fuel and energy related activities and upstream leased assets.
   - Long-term targets: 90% of total Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions, aligned with the 1.5°C scenario.",,,,,
