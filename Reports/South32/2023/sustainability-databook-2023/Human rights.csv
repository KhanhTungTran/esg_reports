,"Our commitment to respecting human rights is a vital part of our approach to sustainability, not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it reflects our values and is critical to sustainable business practice. We manage human, environmental and security risks to protect people and safeguard their rights.

The metrics we use to measure our performance are shown in the tables below. ",,,,,,,

,"(1) Required personnel must undertake VPSHR training every two years. This results in a significant year-on-year variance between training completions between years. Revised training assignment profiles were made in FY23. 
(2) As at 30 June 2023, 81 per cent of our employees have completed mandatory Code of Business Conduct training. This training is required every three years and is supported by an annual assessment module. Selected contractors also complete the training.
(3) Introductory human rights training is completed by selected employees. In FY23, training assignments were paused as the training module was refreshed, resulting in variance in completion numbers. In FY24, the updated training will be reassigned to employees and selected contractors, to be undertaken every two years. Prior to FY23, Introductory human rights training and Modern slavery training completion numbers were combined.
(4) Required personnel must undertake modern slavery training every two years. This results in a significant year-on-year variance in training completions between reporting periods. Revised training assignment profiles were developed in FY23. In FY22 and FY21, Introductory human rights training was included in the total modern slavery training completions as modern slavery content was present in both trainings.  
(5) In FY23, cultural awareness training was delivered at our Cannington, Groote Eylandt Mining Company (GEMCO), Worsley Alumina and South Africa Manganese operations and the Hemosa project to selected employees and contractors. ",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,
,"(1) Human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) are completed at least every five years, if the risk is considered higher due to the location or activity, and are reviewed annually through a self-assessment to maintain currency. Operations that completed HRIAs in FY23 are Cerro Matoso, Hillside Aluminium, Hotazel Manganese Mines (HMM) and Mozal Aluminium. 
(2) Human Rights Risk Self Assessments (HRRSAs) are conducted annually at our operations with a lower exposure to human rights risks, and when high risk operations have conducted self-assessments. Operations that completed HRRSAs in FY23 are Cannington, Hermosa project, Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, and Ambler Metals exploration. 
(3) 67 per cent of our 'operated operations' have completed a HRIA or HRRSA in FY23. Two of the remaining operations commenced their assessments in FY23, and will aim to complete these in FY24. Metalloys is in care and maintenance and is not subject to assessment. ",,,,,,,
