,,,,
,"The below provides our approach to the sub-indicators and metrics detailed in version 2.0 of the Net Zero Company Benchmark, as published by Climate Action 100+ on 30 March 2023. Assessments using Benchmark 2.0 are expected to be released in September / October 2023. Our approach to the sub-indicators and metrics detailed in version 1.0 of the Net Zero Company Benchmark can be found in our 2022 Sustainability Databook.",,,
,,,,
,CA100+ Indicator,,Our approach,
,Indicator 1: Net zero GHG emissions by 2050 (or sooner) ambition   ,,,
,1.1 The company has set an ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner.,,"We have set a medium-term target to halve our operational GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2035 from our FY21 baseline, and a long-term goal to achieve net zero GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. In FY23, we broadened our long-term goal to include Scope 3 emissions, alongside Scope 1 and 2 emissions.",
,Indicator 2: Long-term (2036-2050) GHG reduction target(s)  ,,,
,2.1 The company has set a long-term target for reducing its GHG emissions in the period between 2036 and 2050.,,We have set a long-term goal to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. ,
,2.2 The company's long-term (2036 to 2050) GHG reduction target covers at least 95% of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and the most relevant Scope 3 emissions (where applicable).,,Our long-term goal to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050 covers more than 95 per cent of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and all categories of Scope 3 relevant to our business.,
,2.3 The company’s last disclosed carbon intensity OR its short-term or medium-term targeted carbon intensity OR the company’s expected carbon intensity derived from its long-term GHG reduction target is aligned with or below the relevant sector trajectory needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature increase to 1.5°C with low or no overshoot in 2050.,,We consider that our long-term goal to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050 is aligned with the pathway in the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C. ,
,Indicator 3: Medium-term (2026-2035) GHG reduction target(s)   ,,,
,3.1 The company has set a medium-term target for reducing its GHG emissions in the period between 2027 and 2035.,,We have set a medium-term target to halve our operational GHG emissions by 2035 from our FY21 baseline.,
,3.2 The company's medium-term (2027 to 2035) GHG reduction target covers at least 95% of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and the most relevant Scope 3 emissions (where applicable).,,"Our medium-term target to halve our operational GHG emissions by 2035 from our FY21 baseline covers more than 95 per cent of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Having set a new goal of net zero Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050 in FY23, we are progressing near-term actions including partnering with customers and suppliers to support and codesign emissions reduction programs, contributing to industry decarbonisation and product stewardship initiatives, and supporting the development of innovative technology solutions. Our approach is based on the materiality of Scope 3 GHG emissions in each reported category and the level of control or influence we have on the associated activities.",
,3.3 The company’s last disclosed carbon intensity OR its short-term or medium-term targeted carbon intensity OR the company’s expected carbon intensity derived from its long-term GHG reduction target is aligned with or below the relevant sector trajectory needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature increase to 1.5°C with low or no overshoot in 2050.,,"In developing our medium-term GHG emissions reduction target, we reviewed science-based emissions reduction pathways that seek to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement and limit global warming to well below 2°C, while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C.

Our medium-term target is to reduce our operational GHG emissions by 50 per cent from FY21 levels by 2035. This equates to an annual average reduction of approximately 3.6 per cent (noting that some stakeholders consider full alignment with a 1.5°C goal would include Scope 3 GHG emissions). Our 2022 Climate Change Action Plan references on page 78 of our 2022 Sustainable Development Report, how we have applied the IPCC Special Report Global Warming of 1.5oC, which presents a number of illustrative model pathways for how these net emissions reductions may be achieved, based on different mitigation strategies.",
,Indicator 4: Short-term (up to 2025) GHG reduction target(s)    ,,,
,4.1 The company has set a short-term target for reducing its GHG emissions in the period between 2023 and 2026.,,"In FY22, we evaluated options for establishing a short-term operational GHG emissions reduction target for the business to drive our near-term action. Given the complex technical and commercial challenges in decarbonising energy sources for Hillside Aluminium and Worsley Alumina (which account for approximately 74 per cent of our operational emissions in FY23), we have not set a short-term emissions reduction target at this stage. We will continue to evaluate our options but will only set a short-term target when we are confident that the pathway to meet a short-term target is credible, viable and just.

",
,4.2 The company’s short-term (up to 2026) GHG reduction target covers at least 95% of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and the most relevant Scope 3 emissions (where applicable).,,,
,4.3 The company’s last disclosed carbon intensity OR the company’s expected carbon intensity derived from its short-term GHG reduction target is aligned with or below the trajectory for its respective sector to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature increase to 1.5°C with low or no overshoot in 2026. This is equivalent to IPCC’s Special Report on the 1.5° Celsius pathway P1 or the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.,,,
