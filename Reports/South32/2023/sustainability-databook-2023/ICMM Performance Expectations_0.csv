22,,"Prioritisation\nIn accordance with the ICMM assurance requirements, we have developed prioritisation criteria to identify the sequence of operations subject to third-party validation within a three-year period. Our approach involved identifying appropriate criteria which was used to rank our operations based on their contribution to our total health, safety, environment and social performance indicators. Those with the greatest contribution to these aggregated indicators will be prioritised for third-party validation in the first year, and the remaining operations will be prioritised across the remaining two-year window. This prioritisation criteria has been reviewed by Vice Presidents of Operations in order to inform the proposed sequencing of third party validation activities across our operations. Prioritisation criteria have also been assured by qualified validation service providers (VSPs), KPMG.\n\nWe continue to embed the ICMM PEs throughout our operations, with third-party validation over other operations, self-assessments planned to continue in FY24 and FY25 in accordance with the three-year update cycle defined by the ICMM. \n",,,,,,,,,,,,,
