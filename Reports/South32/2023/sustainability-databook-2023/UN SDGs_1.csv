11,,5 Gender Equality,5.1 End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere,"Inclusion and diversity is a core element of our culture. We know an inclusive and diverse workforce is safer and allows for greater collaboration, innovation and performance. We are committed to building and maintaining an inclusive and diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we operate.\n\nWe align with the International Labour OrganisationÃ¢ÂÂs Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and are guided by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on Gender Equality, the ICMM Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Position Statement and the ICMM Principles: 2 Ã¢ÂÂ Decision Making and 3 Ã¢ÂÂ Human Rights. Our internal reporting mechanisms help leaders monitor our culture and workplace behaviours and identify issues and areas for improvement. \n\nWe are a signatory to the 40:40 Vision, an initiative led by HESTA and supported by industry partners to pursue diversity in executive leadership in ASX300 companies. Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is a founding member of the Champions of Change National 2021 Group, which is a shared commitment to achieving gender balance across workforces and creating a workplace culture that is diverse and inclusive, at all levels and in all locations. Our CEO is also a member of CEOs for Gender Equity, a CEO-led membership organization committed to achieving gender equality in Western Australia. \n\nIn the People and culture tab of the 2023 Sustainability Databook, we have disclosed the pay ratio of women to men based on salary across countries where we have more than 50 South32 employees. \n\nInclusion and diversity principles underpin our recruitment process. We track performance against our inclusion and diversity measurable objectives in our annual Business Scorecard, which is a key determinant of the short-term incentive payments eligible employees receive. Our inclusion and diversity measurable objectives provide a series of targets and actions aimed at improving inclusion and diversity in our workplace.\n\nThe South32 Code of Business Conduct states that 'We don't tolerate bullying, harassment, discrimination, victimisation or intimidation of any kind towards others', and that we are all responsible for 'treating others fairly, with respect and dignity, and without discrimination based on race, gender, age, nationality, marital status, ethnic origin, social class, religion, political views, sexual orientation or disability.'\n\nIn FY23 we continued to support Bush Medijina, a Warningakalina womenÃ¢ÂÂs business on Groote Eylandt in Australia. We also continue to provide family and domestic violence support in Western Australia and New South Wales.",2023 Sustainable Development Report - People and culture (page 28-33)\n2023 Sustainable Development Report - Our societal contribution (page 41-47)
12,,6 Clean Water and Sanitation,"6.4 By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity","Water is a valuable resource that we share and is critical to the sustainability of communities, the environment and our business. In many of the areas where we operate, water is scarce, and we manage risks associated with water security and access for our operations and communities. We are taking near and long-term action to minimise and, where possible, avoid any negative impacts on water availability and quality for the future of our business, local communities, and the environment.\n\nWe recognise that water is a vital shared resource with high social, cultural, spiritual, environmental, and economic value. Access to safe drinking water is an internationally recognised human right, essential to the wellbeing and livelihoods of communities. Access to water is integral to the healthy functioning of natural ecosystems and the cultural and spiritual practices of many communities. We have a role to play in, where possible, avoiding and minimising adverse impacts on water availability and quality.\n\nWater is a critical input for our operations where it is primarily used for processing, suppressing dust and managing tailings, as well as for sanitation and catering for our people. Our Approach to Water Stewardship aims to work towards sustainably managing water resources within our operations and contributing to addressing the shared water challenges in the catchments where we operate. As part of our Approach to Water Stewardship, we are committed to working with our communities supporting local communities and working with them on community water issues they may face, now and in the future.\n\nAll operations and major projects undertake water monitoring programs within their area of influence. These programs are designed to inform us of changes in ground and surface water quality and flow rates. Local regulatory authorities set compliance requirements through our permits and licences, which are managed through monitoring programs, impact and risk assessments. Where possible, we seek to reuse or recycle to limit our reliance on shared water sources in the catchments where we operate.\n\nEach year we reassess which of our operations are exposed to baseline water stress, using the World Resources InstituteÃ¢ÂÂs Aqueduct tool, supplemented by an assessment of local context and catchment conditions. Currently, we have four operations and one development option in areas defined as having baseline water stress: Mozal Aluminium, Worsley Alumina, IMC, HMM and the Hermosa project. For these operations (not considering the Hermosa project) a target was set in FY22 to achieve at least a 10 per cent improvement in water use efficiency by FY27, compared to a baseline of FY21, with a stretch target of more than 15 per cent improvement. During FY23, we planned and implemented activities to meet our FY27 water use efficiency target and integrated prioritised initiatives into our business planning process. Examples include installation of water recirculation infrastructure at our Wessels mine to reclaim additional water previously distributed for evaporation and improving metering at Mozal Aluminium to better inform water efficiency gains. To incentivise achieving our water-related targets, we linked them to our remuneration through inclusion on our business scorecard, a key determinant of the short-term incentive payments we make to all eligible employees. In FY23, the Water Efficiency Target (WET) was to achieve an efficiency improvement of >1 per cent compared to the baseline trajectory set in FY21, or >2 per cent to meet the stretch trajectory. While we exceeded our FY23 stretch target, the pipeline of projects that aim to assist in achieving the FY27 water efficiency trajectory required further consideration.\n\nThis year we also embedded our Ã¢ÂÂvalue of waterÃ¢ÂÂ project, established in FY22, to improve our long-term water planning. This provides planners with a more holistic and risk-based view of water-related planning to improve decision-making and investment planning. To further strengthen our business planning processes, we enhanced our water supply and demand forecasts considering the risks and opportunities that relate to the future water profile at each of our operations and projects.\n\n",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Water (page 63-67)
13,,7 Affordable and Clean Energy,"7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix","Reshaping our portfolio toward the commodities that are critical in the transition to a low-carbon world is part of our strategy and our approach to climate change.\n\nCopper is a key metal used in electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. It is an excellent conductor of electricity, so as the world moves towards electrification, copper will increasingly be used in power related infrastructure, including renewable energy. Under our FY23 1.5ÃÂºC scenario, the primary market for copper could more than double by 2050 due to its role as a critical material in the energy transition. Decarbonisation of the power grid, which results in significant transmission and distribution expansion and renewables build out, together with higher electric vehicle (EV) sales, will underpin copper demand. \n\nGrowth in steel demand is anticipated for renewable energy infrastructure development and vehicle electrification. Lead is used in renewable energy storage systems. \n\nIn FY23, we progressed a prefeasibility study of pathways to decarbonise the electricity supply for Hillside Aluminium. As noted in our 2022 CCAP, given the scale of energy requirements at Hillside Aluminium, we are exploring options to enter into a long-term renewable energy power purchase agreement(s).\n\nWorsley AluminaÃ¢ÂÂs near-term decarbonisation efforts have been focused on energy efficiency at the refinery. The use of natural gas remains an interim step, as we pursue our longer-term energy transition solutions focused on electrification and renewable energy. \n\nOur share of Brazil Aluminium is fully powered by renewable energy sources, while Mozal Aluminium is predominantly powered by renewable energy aside from occasions where back-up power supply is needed. Sierra Gorda transitioned to 100 per cent renewable energy in January 2023.\n\nAs part of our approach to designing Hermosa we are applying low-carbon design principles, seeking to leverage automation and technology, and targeting 100 per cent renewable energy supply.",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Addressing climate change (page 87-117)
14,,8 Decent work and economic growth,"8.5 By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value","The countries we operate in are members of the International Labour Organisation, and we respect international labour standards and seek to comply with local labour laws and regulations. As at 30 June 2023, our workforce comprised 9,616 employees across 10 countries. We provide employment opportunities in the regions where we work, with the aim of creating a workforce that reflects the diverse communities and countries where we operate. We aim to be an employer of choice, providing an inclusive work environment and competitive remuneration to attract, develop and retain talented people. \n\nEmployees have access to our Employee Assistance Program, which offers confidential counselling. They also receive additional benefits that differ across our locations, which may include retirement savings and pension matching programs, personal insurance, medical insurance subsidies, educational assistance, service awards and corporate discount programs. Our market-competitive entitlements for parental leave support eligible employees who are growing their families. We provide opportunities for employees to balance personal and business priorities with flexible and remote work arrangements. \n\nOur Education Assistance Program also supports eligible employees who want to develop their skills and capabilities with formal education and training. In FY23, we engaged 81 vacation students and as at 30 June 2023, we had a further 430 graduates, apprentices, trainees and learners in our talent pipeline. In line with our commitment to inclusion and diversity, 45 per cent of these are women.\n\nOur inclusion and diversity measurable objectives provide a series of targets and actions aimed at improving inclusion and diversity in our workplace. One of our measurable objectives is to continue to target pay equity for our employees, with respect to gender and ethnicity. In FY23, we completed our equity pay review, investing US$338,000 to improve pay equity and narrowly missing our target of reducing spend year-on-year to close the pay gap. \n\nAs a significant employer and investor in Australia, we recognise the positive impact we can have on reconciliation. We plan to release our second Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in 2023. This RAP has more ambitious goals and targets to further increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment and procurement, elevate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices, support cultural heritage projects identified by Traditional Owners and further embed reconciliation across our business.\n\nWe recognise the role that we play in shaping a better future in South Africa through economic transformation and continue to focus on employment equity, Enterprise and Supplier Development (ESD), social investment, job creation, skills development and local economic development. Growing and developing small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs) through ESD is fundamental to the transformation of the South African economy. In FY23, we exceeded our target for ESD spend of US$8.1 million with a total spend of US$14.7 million on a smaller number of SMMEs who were provided funding support. We hold local supplier events to highlight opportunities and provide development programs that help small businesses become procurement ready, increase sales, build competitiveness and enter the value chain of large companies, including South32. This year we continued to provide training to SMMEs to help to meet their needs, relating to financial management, corporate governance, health and safety, human resources and modern slavery.\n\nThis year, we invested 27.7 million in community programs, primarily focused on education and leadership, economic participation, good health and social wellbeing, and natural resource resilience. 7,200 people participated in economic development programs funded by South32, with 2,550 jobs created across 70 communities.",2023 Sustainable Development Report - People and culture (page 28-33)\n2023 Sustainable Development Report - Partnering with communities (page 35-40)\n2023 Sustainable Development Report - Our societal contribution (page 41-47)
15,,,"8.7 Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms.","We are committed to respecting internationally recognised human rights as set out in the International Bill of Rights (comprising the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) and the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our approach is guided by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), the United Nations Global Compact Principles, the ICMM Mining Principles, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR), the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the ICMM Mining Principles: 2 Ã¢ÂÂ Decision Making, 3 Ã¢ÂÂ Human Rights and 4 Ã¢ÂÂ Risk Management. While we work to respect the rights of all stakeholders, we particularly focus our efforts on those people most vulnerable to harm, marginalized or at-risk groups, including Indigenous, Traditional and Tribal Peoples. \n\nWe operationalise our commitments through Our Approach to Human Rights and our internal social performance standard. In FY23, Our Approach to Human Rights was updated to detail the governance framework we have in place to embed the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) across our business and to include the human rights requirements of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM). \n\nWe conduct ongoing human rights due diligence to help us to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how we address any involvement in human rights risks across our operations (including tailings storage facilities (TSFs)) and business relationships. Our human rights due diligence includes Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs), Human Rights Risk Self-assessments (HRRSAs) and supplier human rights assessments. Our internal social performance standard outlines the requirements that operations located in countries where human rights risk is considered high, undertake a HRIA at least every five years.\n\nWe are committed to providing accessible and safe grievance and redress channels for stakeholders to raise complaints about human rights, and where we identify that we have caused or contributed to an adverse human rights impact, we will provide for or cooperate in its remediation through legitimate processes.\n\nOur approach to responsible sourcing is built on a partnership model with our suppliers that aims to minimise health, safety, environmental, human rights, and other social risks. We expect the suppliers we work with to share our values, standards of conduct and to respect human rights, as set out in our Code of Business Conduct (Code) and our Sustainability and Business Conduct - Minimum Supplier Requirements. Where possible, we aim to encourage our non-controlled joint venture partners to adopt standards of conduct that are consistent with ours.\n\nOur activities to manage the risk of modern slavery across our supply chain are provided in our annual Modern Slavery Statement in response to the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 and the United Kingdom's Modern Slavery Act 2015. \n",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Human rights (page 52-56)\n2023 Sustainable Development Report - Responsible value chain (page 57-61)
16,,"9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure","9.3 Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets\n","We support the development and growth of small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs), which contribute to the South African economy as it transitions towards fair economic distribution and the alleviation of poverty. We collaborate and work with SMMEs on Enterprise and Supplier Development (ESD) in South Africa. In FY23, we exceeded our target for ESD spend of US$8.1 million with a total spend of US$10.7 million on a smaller number of SMMEs who were provided funding support. We hold local supplier events to highlight opportunities and provide development programs that help small businesses become procurement ready, increase sales, build competitiveness and enter the value chain of large companies, including South32. This year we continued to provide training to SMMEs to help to meet their needs, relating to financial management, corporate governance, health and safety, human resources and modern slavery.\n\nWe track our performance against a range of key performance metrics and targets. As part of the evolution of our approach to social performance we developed economic development plans, which include local employment and procurement targets, at all operations for the first time in FY23.\n\nWe currently work with more than 5,623 direct suppliers and 195 customers across our value chain. During FY23, local procurement across our operations increased by US$111 million compared to FY22, comprising 22.6 per cent of total non-traded procurement spend.\n\nSupporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses is fundamental to achieving our purpose. We engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander suppliers at different levels of our supply chain, with local sourcing teams explaining to prospective suppliers our procurement processes and how to work with South32. We plan to release our second Innovate RAP in 2023. This RAP has more ambitious goals and targets to further increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment and procurement, elevate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices, support cultural heritage projects identified by Traditional Owners and further embed reconciliation across our business.",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Responsible value chain (page 57-61)
