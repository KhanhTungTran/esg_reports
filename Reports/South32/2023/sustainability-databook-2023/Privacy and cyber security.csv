,Privacy,,,
,"At South32, we respect and protect the personal information and privacy of others. We collect, manage and use personal information in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable privacy laws. Our Privacy Policy is available at www.south32.net.

During the year, we continued to develop our controls for privacy risk, including our company-wide privacy awareness program and our privacy and information management framework.

Our Sustainability and Business Conduct - Minimum Supplier Requirements also require our suppliers confirm that they manage privacy of personal information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.",,,

,Cyber security,,,
,"Cyber breaches are a material risk to our business. We apply a proactive approach, assessing potential risks and taking steps to reduce the likelihood of an incident occurring. We also have mitigation strategies and processes in place should they occur. A comprehensive three year cyber security program delivered a capability uplift and cyber risk exposure reduction. In FY23, a forward-looking two year plan was developed to continue control improvements and will be reviewed in FY24 to align with evolving cyber threats.

South32's cyber controls are designed and operated in alignment with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), an international best practice standard for information security controls. South32 engages independent auditors annually to review our cyber security risk management and control performance to identify any gaps or potential improvements in our information security controls. A comprehensive stewardship program has also been defined to periodically assess all critical cyber controls by the Technology Risk and Compliance function with reporting to the Vice President Digital Technology. Improved cyber security controls have been developed for our operations, to better assess cyber security posture and resilience in both the enterprise and Operational Technology (OT) networks.

South32 maintains a comprehensive cyber security awareness training program that is a mandatory requirement for all South32 employees and agency contractors to complete, both at onboarding and on an annual basis. Tailored cyber awareness training modules are delivered to staff in high-risk roles and Executives. South32 performs monthly automated phishing simulations to identify users falling victim to phishing attacks and to provide further remedial training.

The Cyber security team provides a high-level summary of the information risk treatment plan and control maturity levels (as aligned to NIST CSF - industry best practice) to the Risk and Audit Committee.

,Key highlights and achievements this year include the following: ,,,
, - Second line stewardship activities tested the design and effectiveness of critical cyber security controls as part of ongoing control validation and improvement;,,,
," - We defined enhanced cyber security controls for all operations, to provide more granular management and to create consistency in the implementation of cyber 
   controls across the organisation;",,,
," - We enhanced our security risk assessment and third-party cyber risk management practices by improving processes to assess and monitor new or changing 
   technology within the organisation; and",,,
," - We continued our ongoing work in building a cyber-aware culture and have developed additional reporting and training options for all teams to drive ownership, 
   compliance and user awareness.",,,
,,,,
,"Over the past three years, the cyber team has enhanced our cyber security capabilities and contributed to uplifting our cyber security controls maturity and effectiveness. The cyber risk and controls are continually assessed with recurring control verifications to provide additional assurance. Continuous monitoring and periodic reporting is implemented using a set of pre-defined metrics that measure the performance of security controls.

No high-priority cyber security breaches have occurred in South32's technology environment within the last three years. High-priority refers to cyber breaches that have the potential to result in significant damage to South32 (as per our internal risk management standard and our cyber security incident response plan).",,,
