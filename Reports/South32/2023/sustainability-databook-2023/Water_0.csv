7,,"Water is a valuable resource that we share and is critical to the sustainability of communities, the environment and our business. In many of the areas where we operate, water is scarce, and we manage risks associated with water security and\naccess for our operations and communities. We are taking near and long-term action to minimise and, where possible, avoid any negative impacts on water availability and quality for the future of our business, local communities, and the environment.\n\nWater data has been presented in accordance with the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) Water Accounting Framework (WAF) meets the ICMM disclosure requirements for water quality. This year we incorporated updates to our water accounting methodology in line with both MCA WAF version 2.0 and the ICMM Water Reporting Good Practice Guide (2nd Edition August 2021), including the disclosure of Other managed water. This has enabled reporting of new water metrics such as total water consumption and discharge.\n\nThe metrics we use to measure our performance are shown in the tables below.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To convert unit of measure from megalitres to m3 multiply data by 1,000. Water quality 'Type 1,2,3' are equivalent to MCA WAF quality listed as 'Category 1,2,3'. Of the total freshwater withdrawn from South32's 'operated operations', 10.5 per cent comes from regions with high or extremely high baseline water stress. Of the total water consumed by South32 operations, 19.4 per cent was consumed by operations in regions of high or extremely high baseline water stress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
