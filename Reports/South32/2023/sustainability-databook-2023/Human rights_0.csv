18,,"(1) Required personnel must undertake VPSHR training every two years. This results in a significant year-on-year variance between training completions between years. Revised training assignment profiles were made in FY23. \n(2) As at 30 June 2023, 81 per cent of our employees have completed mandatory Code of Business Conduct training. This training is required every three years and is supported by an annual assessment module. Selected contractors also complete the training.\n(3) Introductory human rights training is completed by selected employees. In FY23, training assignments were paused as the training module was refreshed, resulting in variance in completion numbers. In FY24, the updated training will be reassigned to employees and selected contractors, to be undertaken every two years. Prior to FY23, Introductory human rights training and Modern slavery training completion numbers were combined.\n(4) Required personnel must undertake modern slavery training every two years. This results in a significant year-on-year variance in training completions between reporting periods. Revised training assignment profiles were developed in FY23. In FY22 and FY21, Introductory human rights training was included in the total modern slavery training completions as modern slavery content was present in both trainings. \n(5) In FY23, cultural awareness training was delivered at our Cannington, Groote Eylandt Mining Company (GEMCO), Worsley Alumina and South Africa Manganese operations and the Hemosa project to selected employees and contractors.",,,,,,,
