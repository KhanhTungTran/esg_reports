,"About this Sustainability Databook
This Sustainability Databook (Databook) has been prepared by South32 Limited (ABN 84 093 732 597) for informational purposes only and is intended to assist its investors with understanding its performance with respect to sustainable development. South32 Limited is the ultimate holding company of the South32 group of companies. 

In this report, unless otherwise stated, references to South32, the South32 Group, the Group, we, us, our and similar expressions refer to South32 Limited and its controlled entities and joint arrangements(1)(2). In addition to South32’s controlled entities and joint arrangements, this report may refer to operations that are not controlled or operated by South32. Further details about the reporting boundaries of this report are set out in the Reporting Boundaries tab contained in this Databook. 

This Databook should be read in conjunction with South32’s Annual Report and Sustainable Development Report, together with other periodic and continuous disclosure announcements lodged with the ASX. These documents are available at www.south32.net. This Databook has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the ICMM Mining Principles and Position Statements. 

Monetary amounts in this Databook are expressed in US dollars, unless otherwise stated. Figures in italics indicate that an adjustment has been made since the figures were previously reported.
South32 engaged an independent external assurance organisation, KPMG, to provide the Directors of South32 Limited with assurance on select sustainability information, as explained in the independent assurance report in this Databook. 

Forward-looking statements & scenario analysis 
This Databook contains forward-looking statements, including statements of current intention and expectation and statements of opinion. This includes statements regarding climate change and other environmental and energy transition scenarios. While these forward-looking statements reflect South32’s expectations at the date of this Databook (including with respect to its strategies and plans regarding climate change), they may be affected by a range of variables which could cause actual outcomes and developments to differ materially from those expressed in such statements. These variables include but are not limited to: financial and economic conditions in various countries; fluctuations in demand, price, or currency; operating results; development progress including approvals; risks, including physical, technology and carbon emissions reductions risks; industry competition; loss of market for South32’s products; legislative, fiscal, and regulatory developments; the conduct of joint venture participants and contractual counterparties, and estimates relating to cost, engineering, reserves and resources For further information regarding South32’s approach to risk management, see page 28 to 37 of our Annual Report.

South32 makes no representation, assurance or guarantee as to the accuracy, completeness or likelihood of fulfilment of any forward-looking statement, any outcomes expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement or any assumptions on which a forward-looking statement is based. 

There are also inherent limitations with respect to scenario analysis which is discussed in this Databook, and it is difficult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate. Scenarios do not constitute definitive outcomes or probabilities, and scenario analysis relies on assumptions that may or may not be, or prove to be, correct and may or may not eventuate. Scenarios may also be impacted by additional factors to the assumptions disclosed. Except as required by applicable laws or regulations, South32 does not undertake to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements. South32 cautions against reliance on any forward-looking statements or guidance, particularly in light of the long time horizon which this Databook covers and the inherent uncertainty in possible policy, market and technological developments in the future.
