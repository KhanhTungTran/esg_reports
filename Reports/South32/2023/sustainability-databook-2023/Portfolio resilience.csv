,"We identify and assess climate-related risks in line with our Risk Management Framework. Given the uncertainty regarding how and when climate change risks will impact South32, we complement our risk management approach with scenario analysis to stress test climate-related risks. Since our first climate-related scenario analysis in 2017, we have continued to revise and build upon our assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on our business, using an approach aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).",,,,,

,Primary differences between South32’s FY23 1.5ºC scenario and our base case,,,,,
,"Copper, zinc and manganese primary demand is higher in 2050(1). Higher copper demand is driven by increased requirements for electricity transmission and distribution (80 per cent increase by 2050), renewables and electric vehicles. Higher zinc demand is attributable to higher galvanisation rates to extend the lifetimes of buildings and more deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind technology. Higher manganese demand is driven by increased use of manganese-rich battery chemistries over time under International Energy Agency (IEA) assumptions and higher electric vehicle sales.

Primary demand in the metals complex for aluminium, alumina, nickel and lead is lower in 2050. Material efficiency assumptions, which include improvements in design and manufacturing, lifetime extensions, material substitution and scrap / recycling, lead to lower total and primary demand relative to the base case for aluminium, and alumina. For nickel, lower primary demand is attributable to a higher battery recycling rate. Primary lead demand is lower due to higher recycling rates assumed in our FY23 1.5ºC scenario.

Lower demand for metallurgical coal in 2050 is driven by lower total steel production as well as decarbonisation of steel production. Steel production under our FY23 1.5ºC scenario is lower as material efficiency and longer life cycle assumptions in IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) scenario results in lower steel demand particularly from buildings and construction sector. Decarbonisation of steel production, results in unabated Blast Furnace (BF) Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) being almost phased out by 2050 versus 28 per cent share by 2050 in the base case, which also leads to lower demand for metallurgical coal.

Prices for all commodities except lead are higher. The FY23 1.5ºC scenario assumes higher primary demand for copper, zinc and manganese, which induces the production of higher-cost supply. Carbon costs drive up prices of alumina, aluminium and metallurgical coal(2) to 2030 and remain an important driver of higher prices for alumina and metallurgical coal in 2050. ",,,,,
,"(1) 2050 is a snapshot in time rather than cumulative demand between now and 2050. Lead and zinc primary demand is to 2040.
(2) Prices for metallurgical coal in our model are based on forecasts for seaborne hard coking coal and semi-hard coking coal.",,,,,
,Primary differences between South32's FY21 1.5ºC scenario and FY23 1.5ºC scenario ,,,,,
,Carbon prices (real January 2021): The FY23 1.5ºC scenario applies carbon prices provided by the IEA at a regional level: Advanced economies with net zero emissions pledges will see carbon prices reaching US$250 per tonne of CO2-e in 2050; Emerging market and developing economies with net zero emissions pledges will see carbon prices reaching US$200 per tonne of CO2-e in 2050; Other emerging market and developing economies will see carbon prices reaching US$180 per tonne of CO2-e in 2050. ,,,,,
,"Material efficiency assumptions: The FY21 1.5ºC scenario did not explicitly model improvements in material efficiency. However, the FY23 1.5ºC scenario assumes optimistic material efficiency as the study have been aligned with IEA NZE. Material efficiency assumptions are a key driver behind lower primary demand for steel and aluminium in the FY23 1.5ºC scenario by 2050 e.g., for aluminium, material efficiency assumptions are assumed to reduce total aluminium demand by 19 per cent in 2050.",,,,,
,"Nickel scrap: The FY23 1.5ºC scenario assumes higher uptake of hydrometallurgical recycling processes – increasing from 20 per cent of total battery recycling in North America and Europe today to 50 per cent in 2030. The nickel scrap ratio is largely aligned with the scrap ratio used in the IEA NZE scenario, whereas the FY21 1.5ºC scenario was based on a different set of assumptions. This leads to a nickel scrap rate that is higher in the FY23 1.5ºC scenario (52 per cent in FY23 versus 38 per cent in FY21 for 2050). As a result of the higher scrap ratio, nickel primary demand is lower in the FY23 1.5ºC scenario.",,,,,
,"Battery chemistries: Compared to the FY21 1.5ºC scenario, the FY23 1.5ºC scenario assumes manganese-rich battery chemistries become dominant over nickel-rich chemistries by 2050. Nickel-rich chemistries reach a market share of around 40 per cent in the FY23 1.5ºC scenario in 2040, compared to an 80 per cent market share in the FY21 1.5ºC scenario. This is also a key factor behind lower nickel demand (42 per cent lower in 2050) in the FY23 1.5ºC scenario. ",,,,,
,"Electricity mix: The FY23 1.5ºC scenario uses the electricity mix provided by IEA for the NZE scenario. Overall, there is greater deployment of renewable power (232 exajoules versus 163 exajoules by year 2050). The renewables mix is different between scenarios, primarily because:",,,,,
," - Solar PV power generation (97 exajoules in 2050) is significantly higher in the FY23 1.5ºC scenario than under the FY21 1.5ºC scenario (37 exajoules), driving higher silver demand; ",,,,,
," - Power generation from offshore wind is slightly lower in the FY23 1.5ºC scenario (24 exajoules versus 26 exajoules), which contributes to both lower steel and lead demand; and",,,,,
," - Power generation from geothermal energy is over five times lower in the FY23 1.5ºC scenario (3 exajoules versus 19 exajoules), a key factor in decreased nickel demand. ",,,,,
,"Automobile assumptions: Electric vehicle (EV) sales are higher in the FY23 1.5ºC scenario. EV sales grow at 11 per cent per annum (compound annual growth rate, CAGR) in the FY23 1.5ºC scenario, compared to a 7 per cent per annum CAGR in the FY21 1.5ºC scenario. Electric vehicle sales in the FY23 1.5ºC scenario reach 324 million in 2050, compared to 217 million in the same year in the FY21 1.5ºC scenario. In combination with increased use of manganese-rich batteries over time, higher EV sales contribute to higher manganese demand under the FY23 1.5ºC scenario. ",,,,,

,Carbon Pricing,,,,,
,,,,,,
,Carbon pricing is a key policy tool and enabler to support the global transition to a low-carbon world. We use an internal carbon price to inform our strategic business decisions. ,,,,,
,,,,,,
,"In FY23, following our assessment of external benchmarks, our long-term base case global carbon price assumption remained at US$64 per tonne after inflation adjustment. Further commentary on our FY23 analysis that led to this assessment includes:

- Globally, the coverage of legislated carbon pricing instruments (i.e. tax or trading scheme) increased to 23 per cent of total emissions in CY22 from 21.5 per cent in CY21, and 89 countries had 
  adopted net-zero commitments by end-2022. There was continued momentum for climate actions and carbon policies, which are driven by Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets. At COP27 
  (2022), progress was made in the loss and damage fund and the operational details of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement but no significant NDC updates. In terms of external benchmarks, the World 
  Bank report on State and Trends of Carbon Pricing (2022) reported that carbon prices and taxes were below the price corridor required to meet the Paris Agreement. Simiilarly, the International 
  Monetary Fund (IMF) assessed global average carbon price at US$6 / tCO2-e, much lower than a suggested requirement of US$75/tCO2-e to achieve climate targets. 

- Domestic market developments indicate continued commitment and focus towards net zero goals over the assessed period in our operating jurisdictions. In Australia, the Safeguard Mechanism 
  (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2023 came into effect on 1 July 2023. The industrial facilities (including four South32 operations) covered under the Safeguard Mechanism will adhere to lower emission 
  limits to achieve the 205 million tonnes of CO2 abatement target. In South Africa, the government raised the headline carbon tax rate to ZAR159 (US$7.7) per tonne for CY23 compared to ZAR144 (US
  $8.5) per tonne in CY22. The government also proposed to increase the rate to at least US$30 per tonne in CY30 and US$120 per tonne beyond CY50 as part of the planned two-phase transition. 

- Overall market-driven carbon prices have weathered the 2022 energy crisis well. The European Allowance averaged at EUR84 per tonne (US$94 per tonne) in FY23, 15 per cent higher than FY22.  
  Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) averaged at A$33 per tonne (US$22 per tonne) in FY23, 4 per cent lower compared to FY22, mainly due to an increase in supply. Our internal corporate 
  benchmark survey, which includes 42 companies from the finance, resource, agriculture, and energy sector, indicated that the long-term average internal carbon prices are converging to a range of 
  US$40 per tonne to US$120 per tonne.
