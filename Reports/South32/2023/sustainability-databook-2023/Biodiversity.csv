,"We recognise the importance of protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services and aim to achieve no net loss for all new projects and major expansions. It is our responsibility to minimise the
impacts to the environment and to rehabilitate land disturbed by our activities.

The metrics we use to measure our performance are shown in the tables below. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Total land set aside for conservation (hectares),"3,270(2)",1947,1947,2010,2010,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"(1) This figure is calculated as total land rehabilitated divided by sum of total land disturbed and total land rehabilitated. Noting that the total rehabilitated land was deemed as disturbed land prior to rehabilitation, this calculation method is used to reflect the proportion of all disturbed land that has been rehabilitated to date. Total land that has been disturbed by South32 to date is 18,017 hectares, of which 5,911 hectares have been rehabilitated. 
(2) FY23 total land set aside for conservation includes forest ecosystem restoration and agroforestry at Cerro Matoso, stewardship (offset) sites at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, and areas of significant conservation value, ecological restoration and habitat protection at Worsley Alumina.
