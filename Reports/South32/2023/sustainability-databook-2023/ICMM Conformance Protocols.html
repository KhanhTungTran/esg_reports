      <td>The Conformance Protocols for the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (‘the Conformance Protocols’) have been developed to support the integration of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings \nManagement (GISTM) into ICMM’s existing assurance and validation processes for its member commitments. The Conformance Protocols support self-assessments and independent third party assessments of progress with implementing the GISTM.\n\nIn accordance with our ICMM member requirements, during FY23 we undertook self-assessments across our facilities with ‘extreme’ or ‘very high’ potential consequences to review conformance with the 77 requirements of the Conformance Protocols. We do not have any 'extreme' potential consequence facilities, with only 'very high' consequence Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs) at Worsley Alumina's Bauxite Residue Disposal Areas (BRDAs). The outcomes of these self-assessments are detailed below for each of our tailings storage facilities at Worsley Alumina. \n\nOur alignment with the ICMM tailings conformance protocols were part of KPMG’s external assurance scope during FY23. We engaged third parties to undertake technical reviews in addition to our internal review process to assess our technical content against industry standards.</td>
