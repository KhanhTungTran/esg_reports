,"WASTE, CONTAMINATION AND OTHER EMISSIONS",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,"We are committed to reducing waste generated from our operations and managing contamination and other air emissions to minimise any impact on neighbouring communities and the environment. The safe management of waste and other emissions from our operations and projects, including managing contamination risks,
is essential to operating responsibly.

The metrics we use to measure our performance are shown in the tables below. ",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,Mineral waste,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,Hazardous and non-hazardous waste (kilotonnes),FY23,FY22(3),FY21,FY20,FY19,,
,Total hazardous mineral waste(1),11501,12105,22519,24148,23741,,
,Total non-hazardous mineral waste(2),6000,5710,5403,4849,5458,,
,,,,,,,,
,"(1) Hazardous mineral waste is based on classification by local legislation. This includes hazardous mineral waste from processed raw materials, non-hazardous waste that is comingled with hazardous materials, as well as tailings, slimes, sludge, residues, slag, fly ash, gypsum and coal rejects.
(2) Non-hazardous mineral waste includes tailings, slimes, and residue resulting from the processing of ore which is not classified as hazardous by local legislation. 
(3) Total hazardous mineral waste decreased by 46 per cent between FY21 and FY22 due to the divestment of South Africa Energy Coal (SAEC) in FY21.

,Contamination,,,,,,,

,Acid rock drainage(1),FY23,,,,,,
,Number of sites where acid rock drainage is predicted to occur,3,,,,,,
,Number of sites where acid rock drainage is actively mitigated,1,,,,,,
,Number of sites where acid rock drainage is under treatment or remediation,1,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,"(1) All operations are required to manage the potential for acid rock drainage (ARD) as outlined in our internal environment and climate change standard. In FY23 operations were required to report ARD. Notably ARD was reported as predicted to occur at Cannington, Cerro Matoso (CMSA) and the Hermosa project. ARD is actively managed at Cannington through application of appropriate cover systems and stormwater management. CMSA commenced an ARD study in FY23 which is expected to be completed in FY24.

,Other air emissions by pollutant (tonnes),FY23,FY22,FY21,FY20,FY19,,
,Sulphur oxides (SOx) emissions,41442,39568,40755,41625,38790,,
,Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions(1),10603,9687,10078,12156,24763,,
,Mercury emissions,0.9,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.85,,
,,,,,,,,
,"(1) Reported nitrogen oxides (NOx) value excludes N2O, which is a Greenhouse gas (GHG) and as such is incorporated in our GHG emission reporting where relevant. ",,,,,,,
