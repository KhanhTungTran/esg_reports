,"Nothing is more important than the health, safety and wellbeing of our people. We are committed to working together safely, and continuously improving how we work by embedding safe and sustainable business practices throughout our business and work routines every day.

Incident classification definitions are applied uniformly across our workforce. We have adopted the United States Government Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the ICMM guidelines for the recording and reporting of occupational injuries and illnesses. 

We use leading and lagging indicators to measure our health and safety performance, and disclose incidents where South32 controls the work location or the work activity - shown in the tables below.",,,,,,,

,"(1) A near miss is an event that does not result in any injury, illness, damage, or other loss but had the clear potential to do so. Energy exchange is not a requirement, thus when a rule or control is breached it would be considered a near miss if it had a clear potential to result in undesirable consequences.
(2) A hazard is something that has the potential to cause harm, ill health or injury, or damage to property, plant, or the environment.",,,,,,,
