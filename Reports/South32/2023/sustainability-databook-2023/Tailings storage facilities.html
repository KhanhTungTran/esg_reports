      <td>1. A tailings storage facility is typically either an earth-fill embankment dam or a landform used to store fine grained\nmaterial by-products of the mining operation, washing or separation and metal liberation process. Tailings can be liquid, solid, or a slurry of fine particles. Solid tailings are often used as part of the structure itself and the facility is typically raised in succession throughout the life of the particular mine. Every tailings storage facility is identified and if there are multiple dams (saddle or secondary dams) within that facility, this is detailed within question 20.</td>
