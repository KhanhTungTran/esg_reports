7,,"Since 2019, South32 has undertaken an annual review of our member industry associationsÃ¢ÂÂ policies on climate change and published our findings in our sustainability disclosures. This year's review, supported by an external consultant, covers the period 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023, considering available public documentation including traditional and social media, speeches, submissions, website content and public statements. Data was extracted and filtered utilising Artificial Intelligence technology, and reviewed against evaluation guidelines. The review also considers analysis and reporting of industry association advocacy by InfluenceMap, an independent body mapping climate policy engagement of industry associations. Findings were assessed against South32's climate change positions (see page 116 of our 2023 Sustainable Development Report), to evaluate potential misalignment and any subsequent action required.\n\n",,,
