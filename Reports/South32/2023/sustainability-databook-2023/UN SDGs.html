      <td>Water is a valuable resource that we share and is critical to the sustainability of communities, the environment and our business. In many of the areas where we operate, water is scarce, and we manage risks associated with water security and access for our operations and communities. We are taking near and long-term action to minimise and, where possible, avoid any negative impacts on water availability and quality for the future of our business, local communities, and the environment.\n\nWe recognise that water is a vital shared resource with high social, cultural, spiritual, environmental, and economic value. Access to safe drinking water is an internationally recognised human right, essential to the wellbeing and livelihoods of communities. Access to water is integral to the healthy functioning of natural ecosystems and the cultural and spiritual practices of many communities. We have a role to play in, where possible, avoiding and minimising adverse impacts on water availability and quality.\n\nWater is a critical input for our operations where it is primarily used for processing, suppressing dust and managing tailings, as well as for sanitation and catering for our people. Our Approach to Water Stewardship aims to work towards sustainably managing water resources within our operations and contributing to addressing the shared water challenges in the catchments where we operate. As part of our Approach to Water Stewardship, we are committed to working with our communities supporting local communities and working with them on community water issues they may face, now and in the future.\n\nAll operations and major projects undertake water monitoring programs within their area of influence. These programs are designed to inform us of changes in ground and surface water quality and flow rates. Local regulatory authorities set compliance requirements through our permits and licences, which are managed through monitoring programs, impact and risk assessments. Where possible, we seek to reuse or recycle to limit our reliance on shared water sources in the catchments where we operate.\n\nEach year we reassess which of our operations are exposed to baseline water stress, using the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct tool, supplemented by an assessment of local context and catchment conditions. Currently, we have four operations and one development option in areas defined as having baseline water stress: Mozal Aluminium, Worsley Alumina, IMC, HMM and the Hermosa project. For these operations (not considering the Hermosa project) a target was set in FY22 to achieve at least a 10 per cent improvement in water use efficiency by FY27, compared to a baseline of FY21, with a stretch target of more than 15 per cent improvement. During FY23, we planned and implemented activities to meet our FY27 water use efficiency target and integrated prioritised initiatives into our business planning process. Examples include installation of water recirculation infrastructure at our Wessels mine to reclaim additional water previously distributed for evaporation and improving metering at Mozal Aluminium to better inform water efficiency gains. To incentivise achieving our water-related targets, we linked them to our remuneration through inclusion on our business scorecard, a key determinant of the short-term incentive payments we make to all eligible employees. In FY23, the Water Efficiency Target (WET) was to achieve an efficiency improvement of &gt;1 per cent compared to the baseline trajectory set in FY21, or &gt;2 per cent to meet the stretch trajectory. While we exceeded our FY23 stretch target, the pipeline of projects that aim to assist in achieving the FY27 water efficiency trajectory required further consideration.\n\nThis year we also embedded our ‘value of water’ project, established in FY22, to improve our long-term water planning. This provides planners with a more holistic and risk-based view of water-related planning to improve decision-making and investment planning. To further strengthen our business planning processes, we enhanced our water supply and demand forecasts considering the risks and opportunities that relate to the future water profile at each of our operations and projects.\n\n</td>

It is an excellent conductor of electricity, so as the world moves towards electrification, copper will increasingly be used in power related infrastructure, including renewable energy. Under our FY23 1.5ºC scenario, the primary market for copper could more than double by 2050 due to its role as a critical material in the energy transition. Decarbonisation of the power grid, which results in significant transmission and distribution expansion and renewables build out, together with higher electric vehicle (EV) sales, will underpin copper demand. \n\nGrowth in steel demand is anticipated for renewable energy infrastructure development and vehicle electrification. Lead is used in renewable energy storage systems. \n\nIn FY23, we progressed a prefeasibility study of pathways to decarbonise the electricity supply for Hillside Aluminium. As noted in our 2022 CCAP, given the scale of energy requirements at Hillside Aluminium, we are exploring options to enter into a long-term renewable energy power purchase agreement(s).\n\nWorsley Alumina’s near-term decarbonisation efforts have been focused on energy efficiency at the refinery. The use of natural gas remains an interim step, as we pursue our longer-term energy transition solutions focused on electrification and renewable energy. \n\nOur share of Brazil Aluminium is fully powered by renewable energy sources, while Mozal Aluminium is predominantly powered by renewable energy aside from occasions where back-up power supply is needed. Sierra Gorda transitioned to 100 per cent renewable energy in January 2023.\n\nAs part of our approach to designing Hermosa we are applying low-carbon design principles, seeking to leverage automation and technology, and targeting 100 per cent renewable energy supply.</td>

Our Innovate32 program aims to create value through innovation, with the Next Generation Mine mission to reshape the way we operate and the Low Footprint mission to reduce our impact on the environment. Many of these options are being investigated through several collaborative initiatives, and our work in these areas is expected to influence our business, strategy and financial planning in future. In FY23, we participated in a number of Heavy Industry Low-Carbon Transition Cooperative Research Centre (HILT CRC) projects, covering topics such as decarbonising alumina calcination, the use of mechanical vapour recompression and storage technologies for Bayer steam generation, green heat for industries and regulatory implications, and emissions profiling. \n\nNear-term decarbonisation initiatives at Hillside Aluminium are focused on reducing energy consumption with the use of energy efficiency technology. For example, in FY22 Hillside Aluminium completed a trial of the AP3XLE energy efficiency technology and committed approximately US$18 million to deploy the technology through to FY28. We also continue to investigate and assess additional emissions reduction projects and technologies, such as inert anodes and anode coating technology.\n\nIn FY23 we completed two circular economy pilot studies at Worsley Alumina and Mozal Aluminium. The site-specific Pilots staged approach included establishing the baseline, quantitative analysis, workshop and site visits to deliver Circularity Roadmaps. \n\nThe safe management of tailings storage facilities (TSFs) is an integral part of mining and processing activities. Increased efficiency of processing technologies over time allows some of our operations to recover or recycle economically viable historical tailings materials. Our total tailings recycled has increased by five per cent in FY23 compared to the prior year due to the inclusion of tailings reused in our revised calculations. We are participating in studies for the Hermosa project to assess the retreatment of tailings during the lifecycle of the project as new technologies emerge.

      <td>Water\n\nWater is a valuable resource that we share and is critical to the sustainability of communities, the environment and our business. In many of the areas where we operate, water is scarce, and we manage risks associated with water security and access for our operations and communities. We are taking near and long-term action to minimise and, where possible, avoid any negative impacts on water availability and quality for the future of our business, local communities, and the environment.\n\nWe recognise that water is a vital shared resource with high social, cultural, spiritual, environmental, and economic value. Access to safe drinking water is an internationally recognised human right, essential to the wellbeing and livelihoods of communities. Access to water is integral to the healthy functioning of natural ecosystems and the cultural and spiritual practices of many communities. We have a role to play in, where possible, avoiding and minimising adverse impacts on water availability and quality.\n\nWater is a critical input for our operations where it is primarily used for processing, suppressing dust and managing tailings, as well as for sanitation and catering for our people. Our Approach to Water Stewardship aims to work towards sustainably managing water resources within our operations and contributing to addressing the shared water challenges in the catchments where we operate. As part of our Approach to Water Stewardship, we are committed to working with our communities by supporting local communities and working with them on community water issues they may face, now and in the future.\n\nAll operations and major projects undertake water monitoring programs within their area of influence. These programs are designed to inform us of changes in ground and surface water quality and flow rates. Local regulatory authorities set compliance requirements through our permits and licences, which are managed through monitoring programs, impact and risk assessments. Where possible, we seek to reuse or recycle to limit our reliance on shared water sources in the catchments where we operate.\n\nEach year we reassess which of our operations are exposed to baseline water stress, using the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct tool, supplemented by an assessment of local context and catchment conditions.\n\nThis year we embedded our ‘value of water’ project, established in FY22, to improve our long-term water planning. This provides planners with a more holistic and risk-based view of water-related planning to improve decision making and investment planning. To further strengthen our business planning processes, we enhanced our water supply and demand forecasts considering the risks and opportunities that relate to the future water profile at each of our operations and projects.\n</td>

We manage waste in line with the ICMM Mining Principles: 2 – Decision Making, 4 – Risk Management, 6 – Environmental Performance and 8 – Responsible Production, and apply the mitigation hierarchy that limits waste production and prioritises waste prevention, followed by minimisation, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and disposal.\n\nOur internal standard outlines the requirements that operations use a waste register to improve the way they identify, assess, quantify and report risks and opportunities associated with all their waste streams. All our operations are required to maintain an updated contamination register outlining the location of all known contamination as well as a description of the history of the originating event, control actions and remediation details. As part of our continuous improvement, this year we updated our waste-related performance requirements in our internal environmental and climate change standard to strengthen waste management across our operations. All operations are required to complete a self-assessment against the requirements of the internal standard and complete agreed action plans to close any identified gaps.\n\nCareful segregation and containment of waste provides the opportunity for material to be recovered and beneficially used in the future as the national and international circular economy matures. In FY23 we completed two circular economy pilot studies at Worsley Alumina and Mozal Aluminium.\n\nOther air emissions refer to non-greenhouse gas air emissions from our operations such as sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulates (including dust), odour, vibration, light and noise. Our approach to managing other air emissions considers the acute, incremental and cumulative impacts of other air emissions on sensitive receptors, including communities located within the relevant airshed.</td>

We are committed to implementing relevant global industry standards at all South32 operated TSFs as part of our focus on operating responsibly. We are also committed to pursuing opportunities that will improve reuse and recovery of our tailings waste streams thus reducing our environmental footprint and closure legacy.\n\nWe recognise the potential risks TSFs present to our people, our communities, the environment and shareholders. Our ‘Approach to Tailings Management’ reflects our commitment to safe and responsible management throughout the TSF lifecycle and applies to South32 operated TSFs. Our overarching approach to tailings management is to achieve stable and dense tailings. This involves understanding tailings behaviour, reducing water content at TSFs, and developing innovative construction techniques for these TSFs. We actively look at how we can apply innovative solutions to improve how we manage tailings. We conduct risk assessments at each of our operated TSFs and associated major projects for material risks.\n\nOur approach to tailings management is consistent with the ICMM Tailings Management: Good Practice Guide, which is informed by the requirements of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) and the commitments in the ICMM’s Tailings Governance Framework Position Statement, the Australian National Committee on Large Dams (ANCOLD) guidelines, as well as the ICMM Mining Principles. Meeting the requirements of the GISTM is a key focus for South32 and we actively support improvements in tailings management through the ICMM Tailings Working Group, industry conferences and research projects.</td>

Our Sustainability Policy reaffirms our commitment to sustainable development and outlines our commitment to governance and transparency on sustainability matters.\n\nWe are committed to transparently reporting our sustainability performance, in line with our Sustainability Policy and the ICMM Mining Principle 1 – Ethical Business. Transparency in disclosing our sustainability performance and progress is essential to build trust and demonstrate delivery on our commitments. Our 2023 Sustainable Development Report explains how our business-wide processes support our sustainability commitments, how we manage our most important sustainability topics, and the progress we have made during FY23.\n\nWe undertake annual sustainability materiality assessments to proactively anticipate, identify and assess the sustainability topics that matter most to our business and stakeholders. Our materiality assessments are guided by the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 2021. The results of the materiality assessment are used to inform the content of this report and to inform and strengthen our management of sustainability topics.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021, Recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the ICMM Mining Principles and Position Statements. In our 2023 Sustainability Databook we also demonstrate how we are pursuing alignment with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation’s Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standard for the Metals and Mining industry. In line with our ICMM membership requirements and transparency commitments, we obtain independent assurance over selected sustainability information.\n\nWe work together with value chain partners to reduce emissions by sharing insights, enhancing monitoring and reporting, developing scalable innovation and linking performance to targets. In FY23, we developed an approach to track and influence the reduction of Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with suppliers. We continue to request customers to provide their Modern Slavery and Conflict Minerals Statements as part of our social risk due diligence activities.

This goal recognises that we have a critical role to play in contributing to the decarbonisation of the value chain and reflects our commitment to collaborating with our suppliers, customers, joint venture partners, industry peers and other value chain partners to make a meaningful contribution to the actions and innovations required to address Scope 3 emissions. We also have a medium-term target – to halve our operational GHG emissions by 2035 from our FY21 baseline. Our medium-term target and long-term goal apply to our group-wide business. Separately, we have taken into account the regulatory targets, baselines, carbon budgets and other emissions-related indicators specific to each facility that are set by, or comply with, various national and sub-national regulatory schemes in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nOur advocacy on climate change is underpinned by our positions on key climate change matters. These positions inform our decision making, support our external engagement with stakeholders and guide our contributions to public policy development either directly or indirectly through our industry associations. In FY23, this included contributing to industry association formal submissions to the Australian Government’s Safeguard Mechanism reforms, designed to facilitate Australia achieving its commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 43 per cent by 2030.

In FY23 we increased the amount of land protected for conservation, through an additional 1,323 hectares of land, associated with lease holdings at Worsley Alumina. Conservation is focused on matters that exist under the Worsley Protected Areas Procedure with associated spatially defined protected areas. The conservation areas include riverine and riparian habitat to improve ecological linkage and habitat continuity across the landscape, and high conservation value areas.\n\nAt Cerro Matoso, we have an ongoing ecological restoration program with local communities. The program, which has over 240 members, supports the restoration and conservation of native flora and fauna species in the Cordoba region of Colombia. As of December 2022, over 58,000 native plants have been planted on 291 hectares of land, previously degraded by agricultural activity, with plans in place to undertake similar restoration activity on an additional 973 hectares of degraded land. The program supports nursery activities to grow trees, with community members also helping with sowing activities. It has led to wider socio-economic benefits, with the establishment of local companies to provide Cerro Matoso with forestry services.\n\nAt IMC we continue to monitor offset stewardship sites and are working on installing nest boxes to provide supplementary habitat for species in rehabilitated areas, as well as the installation of bee hotels. These hotels have been installed in the Hairy Geebung (Persoonia hirsute) offset area and provide habitat for native solitary bees that commonly pollinate the Hairy Geebung. IMC and Symbio Wildlife Park launched a new three-year partnership in FY23 to help support koala conservation in the Illawarra and Macarthur regions of New South Wales. The Illawarra and Macarthur regions have some of the most genetically pure koalas in Australia and this new partnership directly enables important conservation measures to be fast-tracked.</td>
