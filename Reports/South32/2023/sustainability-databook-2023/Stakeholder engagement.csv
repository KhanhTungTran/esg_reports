,"Respectful relationships with our stakeholders underpin our goal of creating and protecting social, economic, and environmental value. The expectations of stakeholders and society more broadly are constantly evolving in response to global challenges that affect current and future generations – including climate change, wars and conflict, human rights violations and water scarcity, amongst others. 

In delivering our purpose, we seek to create enduring social, environmental and economic value, in a way that aligns with our purpose and values. We work to build positive, meaningful and respectful relationships, guided by the ICMM Mining Principles 9 – Social Performance and 10 – Stakeholder Engagement, as well as our Code of Business Conduct (Code) and internal standards.

South32 have identified our main stakeholders – these being individuals or groups who may be affected by or interested in our decision-making and activities – and developed stakeholder engagement plans at an operational and country levels to help build strong and mutually beneficial relationships. Our stakeholder engagement plans are updated annually and are informed by our local context and stakeholder feedback. Engagement with stakeholders can take many forms and is critical in helping us understand their interests, expectations, and concerns. We use the outcomes from stakeholder engagement to help inform and guide our sustainability efforts. Our engagement with stakeholders varies depending on the location of the operation and the nature and impact of South32 activities on the stakeholder, in accordance with our stakeholder engagement plans. We seek to understand stakeholder concerns and facilitate engagement in a way that considers potential barriers such as language or cultural differences. This is especially important when engaging with minorities and vulnerable groups.

We provide information about our Company and communicate with our stakeholders through our website and social media platforms including Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, YouTube, and Instagram. We encourage our stakeholders to access information about us at www.south32.net, including our latest announcements and news, financial and operational results, annual reports, presentations, and speeches. Shareholders and other stakeholders can contact us through our website or through our Investor Relations or Media Relations teams, with contact details available at www.south32.net. We are committed to communicating with our shareholders and other market participants in a way that is factual, complete, balanced, and clear. ",,,,,

,"Our people 
Employees and agency contractors who work for us.  ","Our people are fundamental to our success and we recognise the importance of timely and transparent engagement. 
 
Our employees’ perspectives and feedback are important to us. With a well-informed and engaged workforce, we are best placed to achieve our strategy. 

Our Board understands the importance of connecting with our people to establish trust and build confidence in its stewardship.","We engage with our people using a variety of communication channels. This includes meetings, videos, toolbox talks, newsletters, leadership calls, presentations, training, and web-based forums, including SharePoint, Teams, Viva Engage (previously Yammer), and our external digital channels. The frequency of our engagement depends on the engagement channel and stakeholder needs.

We survey our employees annually to better understand their day-to-day lived experience, their perceptions of our culture and identify areas for improvement. Employees and contractors have access to Speak Up processes to report conduct that does not align with our values and Code. We connect with employee representatives and representative groups via telephone conversations, face-to-face meetings, negotiations, letters and emails, as required. We also run onboarding and exit interviews. 

Board engagement with our workforce includes visits to our sites as part of Board programs, which are an important part of our Board’s work and provide the opportunity for our Directors to better understand the challenges our people face, and our workplace culture. Our Board formally engages with management via presentations to Board meetings, and lunch and learn sessions with different areas of the business to receive updates on a particular topic, risk or opportunity. Additionally, all Lead Team members attend Board meetings and the annual Strategy Day. ","- Safety and health

,"Local communities 
Communities near our operations and development options who are potentially affected by our presence including vulnerable and marginalised groups and/or at-risk people and groups.","We engage with our local communities to understand their expectations, opportunities, concerns, and interests. These are considered in the development of our stakeholder engagement plans, which help to build strong and mutually beneficial relationships.

We are proud to invest in local communities and aim to contribute to the social, economic, and institutional development of host countries and communities. We design our social investment and economic development plans with input from our local communities to include their development opportunities, aspirations and needs.","We facilitate regular, open and inclusive dialogue with local community stakeholders. In accordance with our stakeholder engagement plans our engagements vary depending on the location of the operation and the stakeholder. Engagements typically include face-to-face meetings, community consultative committees, workshops and forums, operational open days, newsletters, web-based information, community perception surveys, telephone conversations and site visits.

Our complaints and grievance mechanisms are available for members of the community, who can use these services anonymously. Given our diverse operating locations, we aim to develop activity-specific, locally appropriate and culturally sensitive complaints and grievance processes."," - Climate change and our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets

,"Indigenous, Traditional and Tribal Peoples 
Indigenous, Traditional and Tribal Peoples near our operations and development options that have an interest in and/or may be affected by our activities.","We are committed to working with Indigenous, Traditional and Tribal Peoples to protect and preserve cultural heritage; build strong relationships; and work in partnership to deliver long-term opportunities, through employment, procurement, community investment and training.

We endeavour to engage local communities, including Indigenous, Traditional and Tribal Peoples, to inform our rehabilitation activities, particularly on aspects such as the provenance of local plant species and seeds, harvesting and storage of seeds and methods to facilitate successful rehabilitation. ","We engage with Indigenous, Traditional and Tribal Peoples using culturally appropriate methods throughout the mining lifecycle to foster relationships based on transparency and trust. 

We have culturally sensitive community complaints mechanisms and other Speak Up processes that Indigenous, Traditional and Tribal Peoples can use to provide feedback, complaints or concerns. 

We apply the principles and processes of free, prior, and informed consent in seeking to obtain and maintain agreed outcomes with Indigenous, Traditional and Tribal Peoples. 

We equip our people to be more culturally aware by, for example, creating opportunities for open discussion amongst our employees on the Australian Indigenous voice to parliament by sharing why South32 supports this initiative, how it links to our purpose and how they can be more engaged.

This year we updated our Approach to Cultural Heritage (previously published in 2021) to apply globally, and developed Our Approach to Indigenous, Traditional and Tribal Peoples Engagement.

,"Investors 
Shareholders in our business.","We present our performance, strategy and prospects to shareholders and potential investors, in accordance with securities law, to achieve a fair valuation of South32 securities in the equity markets. 

Investor expectations on ESG-related issues continue to increase, with an ongoing emphasis on demonstrated action and performance. We integrate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) materials into our customary investor engagement activities and ESG-focused engagement activities are included in our annual investor engagement program.

Proactive direct investor engagement also provides opportunity for us to seek feedback and understand expectations, including in relation to our disclosures and annual reporting. ","Effective two-way communication is important for our shareholders to exercise their rights as our owners. We maintain a program of engagement involving our Directors, Lead Team, shareholders, and the broader investment community, which generally includes briefings and presentations, including live webcasts and question-and-answer sessions; site tours; meetings attended by our Chair, CEO (Chief Executive Officer) and/or other Lead Team members; as well as events and forums. 

Our shareholders have the option to receive our communications electronically and can contact us electronically. Shareholders may also communicate electronically with our share registries.

Our Investor Relations, External Affairs and Company Secretariat teams provide regular updates to our Board on feedback received from, and key matters raised by, our shareholders and key stakeholders, including our response, where appropriate.

,"Financial community 
Including lenders, bond holders, debt, equity, insurers and ESG analysts.","We present our performance and strategy to our lenders, rating agencies and other financial institutions, who are focussed on the sustainability considerations that may affect our credit profile and performance against our sustainability-linked loan, which supports the Group’s ability to maintain a diversity of funding sources.

There is also growing interest from the financial community in the role of non-financial information, specifically ESG information, including South32’s associated performance, risks and opportunities. 

We support global efforts to align sustainability reporting standards. During the financial year, we provided feedback as part of the public consultation period for the Exposure Drafts of the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information and IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). This year we undertook a readiness assessment against the IFRS S1 and S2 Exposure Drafts to identify improvement opportunities for our sustainability reporting processes as we prepare for these new standards.

We regularly monitor and review the ratings published by ESG data providers and research houses (and participate in select third-party questionnaires and data verification exercises) to ensure, to the extent possible, that these assessments accurately reflect our performance, disclosures and annual reporting. This work also informs our disclosure decisions.","We present on matters, including performance metrics and results, in a timely manner. We answer bond holders, debt, equity, insurers, lenders and rating agency requests (phone, email and face-to-face discussions). 

We regularly meet with the financial community through engagements such as roadshows or conference calls, including Lead Team or Board members in these engagements, as required. We also engage regularly with representatives from investor-led initiatives such as Climate Action 100+.

We align with investor-focused ESG reporting initiatives, such as IFRS Foundation’s Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standard for the Metals and Mining industry and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We also respond to ESG analysts' and rating organisations’ information requests.","- Climate change strategy, associated targets and goals, capex, and progress, including the pipeline of decarbonisation projects

,"Customers 
Companies that buy our products.","We seek to apply responsible business practices throughout our value chain. 

We understand and respond to the increasing need for transparency on our sustainability performance from customers. Customers expect transparency in their supply chains to better understand the origins of the products they purchase. Sustainability credentials from independent associations can reinforce environmentally responsible practices and stakeholder confidence in certain products.","We engage with our customers both face-to-face and virtually. We engage frequently through a regular schedule and as required.

We respond and work with ESG rankers and raters – such as EcoVadis – to provide transparent information on our sustainability performance. In December 2022, we received an updated South32 group-level sustainability scorecard and silver medal rating from EcoVadis, an international sustainability ratings service that reviews organisational sustainability performance and develops scorecards that can be shared with value chain partners.

We continue to request customers to provide their Modern Slavery and Conflict Minerals Statements as part of our social risk due diligence activities.

,"Suppliers and contractors
Large and small businesses that we procure goods and services from.","We seek to apply responsible business practices throughout our value chain by sourcing responsibly. We need surety of supply for the various products we purchase, as well as understanding the supply chain we are purchasing from.

We collaborate with small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs), including minority led – such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander-owned - businesses to help them enter the value chains of large companies, including South32. In South Africa, we aim to work with an increasing number of Black-owned suppliers. 

We are collaborating with our suppliers on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improving accounting of GHG emissions associated with processing and use of our products, participating in relevant stewardship and innovation initiatives, and maturing our monitoring program for shipping emissions to inform future emissions reduction opportunities. 
","We engage suppliers regularly through contractual agreements, due diligence activities, performance reviews and training, and according to our internal standards and ongoing updates.

Local sourcing teams engage with local communities and Indigenous, Traditional and Tribal Peoples on prospective supply opportunities through supplier events. 

This year, we enhanced due diligence processes for onboarding new trading partners and raw material suppliers to manage counterparty, financial, legal, business integrity and reputational risks.

We continue to identify potential partners for collaboration on Scope 3 emissions reduction, particularly those partners who provide goods and services to South32.","- Enhanced South32 Contractor Management System of Work with a focus on contractor safety
