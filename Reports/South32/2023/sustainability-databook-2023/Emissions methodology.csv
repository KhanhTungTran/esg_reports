,Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions methodology,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,"We calculate our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions according to the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol (revised edition).  Our calculations are aligned with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1, 2 and 3 methodologies, industry standards, as well as country-specific standards and methods, including the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination 2008 (NGER Determination), the South African National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Regulations and the South African Carbon Tax Act, 2019. We apply the operational control consolidation approach and use the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) from the IPCC Assessment Report 5 (AR5) - 100 year time horizon. ",,,,,,
,"We use a  range of GHG emission factors in the calculation of our GHG emissions. For our Australian operations, we apply GHG emission factors from the NGER Determination, Compilation no.14 dated 1 July 2022. For our South African operations, we apply the GHG Emission factors published in the Methodological Guidelines for Quantification of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, dated 1 October 2022, the Eskom grid emission factor, as well as certain site specific emission factors. Our Colombia operations apply the Emission factors of the UPME, Colombia’s National Mining and Energy Planning Unit, Colombian National Interconnected System, 2022. Our Mozambique operation applies the Eskom grid emission factor, factors from Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) as well as certain site specific or IPCC default emission factors. Our Scope 1 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions include the following gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, PFCs and SF6. ",,,,,,

,Scope 3 GHG emissions methodology,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,"We calculate our Scope 3 emissions in accordance with the methodologies in the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Detail on the specific methodologies used for each Scope 3 category is listed below. The most material emissions are from Category 10 and Category 11, which account for approximately 83 per cent of our Scope 3 inventory. 
Accounting for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions leads to an inevitable overlap in reporting boundaries.

The most significant example of double counting within our inventories is in category 10: processing of sold products, which could include raw materials that are produced by South32 and accounted for elsewhere in our inventories (e.g. bauxite used in the production of alumina and in turn, alumina used in the production of aluminium ingots). 

Emissions are accounted for on an equity share basis for categories 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 11 and 15 and on a 100 per cent basis for categories 3, 6 and 7.",,,,,,

For time-chartered vessels and voyage chartered vessels, individual vessel GHG emissions are calculated from reported (actual) voyage bunker consumption for the laden and ballast legs as per the Sea Cargo Charter Methodology. In the event no actual bunker consumption data is available, an estimated distance and tonnage carried is used in the calculation using AIS data and other shipping sources. 
 
GHG emissions for containerised cargo are estimated according to the Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG) methodology. ",
