,"Water is a valuable resource that we share and is critical to the sustainability of communities, the environment and our business. In many of the areas where we operate, water is scarce, and we manage risks associated with water security and
access for our operations and communities. We are taking near and long-term action to minimise and, where possible, avoid any negative impacts on water availability and quality for the future of our business, local communities, and the environment.

Water data has been presented in accordance with the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) Water Accounting Framework (WAF) meets the ICMM disclosure requirements for water quality. This year we incorporated updates to our water accounting methodology in line with both MCA WAF version 2.0 and the ICMM Water Reporting Good Practice Guide (2nd Edition August 2021), including the disclosure of Other managed water. This has enabled reporting of new water metrics such as total water consumption and discharge.

The metrics we use to measure our performance are shown in the tables below. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2) Other managed water consumption is the total volume of other managed water removed by evaporation or other losses, and not released back to surface water, groundwater, seawater or a third party.
(3) Total discharge is the total of other managed water outputs/discharge plus operational water outputs / discharge.
(4) Water use efficiency is calculated as the total recycling and reuse divided by the sum of total recycling and reuse and total operational inputs / withdrawal. 
(5) Operational water consumption has increased by 72 per cent in FY23, as result of improved water accounting to align with MCA WAF 2.0 and ICMM Water Accounting / reporting updates. 
(6) Due to changes in reporting methodology and data collection boundaries, FY22  ‘other’ water outputs / discharge and operational water consumption values may be subject to change. The impact of these changes will be assessed in FY24, and any material restatements will be disclosed in our 2024 Sustainability Databook. 
(7) Recycling and reuse, and efficiency for FY19-22 has materially changed through a water accounting change with the addition of Mozal casthouse water recycled and reused. This change has resulted in restatements, with a 9 per cent increase in total water recycled / reused in FY22, a 16 per cent increase in FY21, 12 per cent increase in FY20, and an 11 per cent increase in FY20.

(2) FY23 data includes the following operations: Worsley Alumina Refinery, Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, Mozal Aluminium, Hotazel Manganese Mines; as well as the Hermosa project, all of which contribute to South32 total water inputs and outputs. These figures exclude Cerro Matoso, Hillside Aluminium, Metalloys, Cannington, Groote Eylandt Mining Company, Worsley Alumina Mine and Materials operations, Bayside, Eagle Downs and Mine Closure NPI projects, and corporate offices. 
(3) Combined water consists of both operational water and other managed water.
(4) Other managed water consumption is the total volume of other managed water removed by evaporation or other losses, and not released back to surface water, groundwater, seawater or a third party.
(5) Total discharge is the total of other managed water outputs/discharge plus operational water outputs / discharge.
(6) Water efficiency is calculated as the total recycling and reuse divided by the sum of total recycling and reuse and total operational inputs/withdrawal.
(7) Recycling and reuse, and efficiency for FY20-22 has materially changed with the addition of Mozal casthouse water recycled and reused - a water accounting change. 
(8) Data reported for SASB Metals and Mining Sustainability Accounting Standard, 2018 metric EM-MM-140a.1 as follows: Total fresh water withdrawn and consumed is presented as Inputs (Withdrawals) Type 1 water (as per MCA WAF, 2022) and FY23 total consumption, respectively. To convert unit of measure from megalitres to m3 multiply data by 1,000. Water quality 'Type 1,2,3' are equivalent to MCA WAF quality listed as 'Category 1,2,3'. Of the total freshwater withdrawn from South32's 'operated operations', 10.5 per cent comes from regions with high or extremely high baseline water stress. Of the total water consumed by South32 operations, 19.4 per cent was consumed by operations in regions of high or extremely high baseline water stress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
