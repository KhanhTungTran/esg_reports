,"Since 2019, South32 has undertaken an annual review of our member industry associations’ policies on climate change and published our findings in our sustainability disclosures. This year's review, supported by an external consultant, covers the period 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023, considering available public documentation including traditional and social media, speeches, submissions, website content and public statements. Data was extracted and filtered utilising Artificial Intelligence technology, and reviewed against evaluation guidelines. The review also considers analysis and reporting of industry association advocacy by InfluenceMap, an independent body mapping climate policy engagement of industry associations. Findings were assessed against South32's climate change positions (see page 116 of our 2023 Sustainable Development Report), to evaluate potential misalignment and any subsequent action required.

,Arizona Mining Association (AMA),"Arizona, USA","The AMA acknowledges the importance of addressing climate change. The AMA encourages its members to implement strategies that lead to sustained reductions in climate change risk. While the specifics of the Paris Agreement, such as the goal of limiting global warming to below 2ºC, are not explicitly mentioned, the AMA's commitment to collaborating and combating climate challenge is evident. ","Policy positions and advocacy are, on balance, aligned."
,Australian Aluminium Council (AAC),Australia,"The AAC: 
- supports the Paris Agreement and Australia's commitment to net zero by 2050;
