,"(1) Grid electricity represents 46 per cent of total energy use.
(2) 'Other' includes consumption of biomass, ethanol, and petroleum based oils and greases. 
(3) Total energy use excludes renewable sources. Reduction in energy consumption of 2 petajoules between FY22 and FY23. To convert from petajoules to gigajoules multiply by 1,000,000. 1 petajoule equates to 277,778 megawatt hours.
(4) Renewable sources include biomass consumption and solar electricity generation at our Worsley Alumina operation, hydroelectricity sourced from Cahora Bassa at our Mozal Aluminium operation, and hydroelectricity sourced from the Colombia National Interconnected System at our Cerro Matoso operation.
(5) Energy Use - Other has materially changed following recalculations at Worsley Alumina. This change has resulted in a 263 per cent increase when compared to our FY22 disclosures.
