      <td>Respectful relationships with our stakeholders underpin our goal of creating and protecting social, economic, and environmental value. The expectations of stakeholders and society more broadly are constantly evolving in response to global challenges that affect current and future generations – including climate change, wars and conflict, human rights violations and water scarcity, amongst others. \n\nIn delivering our purpose, we seek to create enduring social, environmental and economic value, in a way that aligns with our purpose and values. We work to build positive, meaningful and respectful relationships, guided by the ICMM Mining Principles 9 – Social Performance and 10 – Stakeholder Engagement, as well as our Code of Business Conduct (Code) and internal standards.\n\nSouth32 have identified our main stakeholders – these being individuals or groups who may be affected by or interested in our decision-making and activities – and developed stakeholder engagement plans at an operational and country levels to help build strong and mutually beneficial relationships. Our stakeholder engagement plans are updated annually and are informed by our local context and stakeholder feedback. Engagement with stakeholders can take many forms and is critical in helping us understand their interests, expectations, and concerns. We use the outcomes from stakeholder engagement to help inform and guide our sustainability efforts. Our engagement with stakeholders varies depending on the location of the operation and the nature and impact of South32 activities on the stakeholder, in accordance with our stakeholder engagement plans. We seek to understand stakeholder concerns and facilitate engagement in a way that considers potential barriers such as language or cultural differences. This is especially important when engaging with minorities and vulnerable groups.\n\nWe provide information about our Company and communicate with our stakeholders through our website and social media platforms including Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, YouTube, and Instagram. We encourage our stakeholders to access information about us at www.south32.net, including our latest announcements and news, financial and operational results, annual reports, presentations, and speeches. Shareholders and other stakeholders can contact us through our website or through our Investor Relations or Media Relations teams, with contact details available at www.south32.net. We are committed to communicating with our shareholders and other market participants in a way that is factual, complete, balanced, and clear.</td>
