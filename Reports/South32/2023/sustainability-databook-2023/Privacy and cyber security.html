      <td>Cyber breaches are a material risk to our business. We apply a proactive approach, assessing potential risks and taking steps to reduce the likelihood of an incident occurring. We also have mitigation strategies and processes in place should they occur. A comprehensive three year cyber security program delivered a capability uplift and cyber risk exposure reduction. In FY23, a forward-looking two year plan was developed to continue control improvements and will be reviewed in FY24 to align with evolving cyber threats.\n\nSouth32's cyber controls are designed and operated in alignment with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), an international best practice standard for information security controls. South32 engages independent auditors annually to review our cyber security risk management and control performance to identify any gaps or potential improvements in our information security controls. A comprehensive stewardship program has also been defined to periodically assess all critical cyber controls by the Technology Risk and Compliance function with reporting to the Vice President Digital Technology. Improved cyber security controls have been developed for our operations, to better assess cyber security posture and resilience in both the enterprise and Operational Technology (OT) networks.\n\nSouth32 maintains a comprehensive cyber security awareness training program that is a mandatory requirement for all South32 employees and agency contractors to complete, both at onboarding and on an annual basis. Tailored cyber awareness training modules are delivered to staff in high-risk roles and Executives. South32 performs monthly automated phishing simulations to identify users falling victim to phishing attacks and to provide further remedial training.\n\nThe Cyber security team provides a high-level summary of the information risk treatment plan and control maturity levels (as aligned to NIST CSF - industry best practice) to the Risk and Audit Committee.\n\n</td>
