,"At South32, we are committed to providing relevant and timely information to our stakeholders through regular and transparent disclosure of our environmental and social performance. South32 have previously participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), including disclosures on CDP's climate change and water topics. In recent years, we have opted not to participate in the CDP as we focus our efforts on aligning our reporting with the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Our climate-related financial disclosures, which we consider to be consistent with the four recommendations and the 11 recommended disclosures of the TCFD, are set out in the Addressing Climate Change section of our 2023 Sustainable Development Report and this 2023 Sustainability Databook, with additional disclosures in connection with the governance-related recommendations and recommended disclosures found in our 2023 Corporate Governance Statement. 

The Index below outlines our reporting approach to the recommended disclosures of the TCFD, inclusive of 2021 Guidance for All Sectors and Supplemental Guidance for Non-Financial Groups.",,,,,
