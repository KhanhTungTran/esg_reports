7,,We recognise the importance of protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services and aim to achieve no net loss for all new projects and major expansions. It is our responsibility to minimise the\nimpacts to the environment and to rehabilitate land disturbed by our activities.\n\nThe metrics we use to measure our performance are shown in the tables below.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Noting that the total rehabilitated land was deemed as disturbed land prior to rehabilitation, this calculation method is used to reflect the proportion of all disturbed land that has been rehabilitated to date. Total land that has been disturbed by South32 to date is 18,017 hectares, of which 5,911 hectares have been rehabilitated. \n(2) FY23 total land set aside for conservation includes forest ecosystem restoration and agroforestry at Cerro Matoso, stewardship (offset) sites at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, and areas of significant conservation value, ecological restoration and habitat protection at Worsley Alumina.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
