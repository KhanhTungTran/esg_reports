23,,,,"Closure \n\nClosure is a crucial aspect of our operational lifecycle, and we prioritise effective planning for closure from the early stages of development and throughout our operations life cycle. Through our comprehensive approach to closure, we strive to achieve responsible and sustainable outcomes while meeting regulatory requirements and fulfilling our commitments to all stakeholders. We aim to communicate opportunities in the closure planning and execution process to our host communities, and work towards safe and sustainable environmental outcomes, while also supporting socio-economic outcomes during the closure process.\n\nWe review our closure plans annually and conduct comprehensive updates every three years to factor in climate change impacts, evolving operating contexts, legislative requirements, and stakeholder expectations.\n\nThis year we have furthered our closure vision and planning processes and continue to work on integrating biodiversity and rehabilitation management into closure planning. Detailed closure engineering studies have begun for operations with less than 10 years before their expected closure date. The studies examine post-mining land uses, current infrastructure and land use, remediation and rehabilitation, and an assessment of the socio-economic impact on communities.",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Closure (page 83-86)\n
24,,,,"Tailings \n\nIncreased efficiency of processing technologies over time allows some of our operations to recover or recycle economically viable historical tailings materials. \n\nThe safe management of tailings storage facilities (TSFs) is essential to protect the environment and surrounding communities. We are committed to implementing relevant global industry standards at all South32 operated TSFs as part of our focus on operating responsibly. We are also committed to pursuing opportunities that will improve reuse and recovery of our tailings waste streams thus reducing our environmental footprint and closure legacy.\n\nWe recognise the potential risks TSFs present to our people, our communities, the environment and shareholders. Our Ã¢ÂÂApproach to Tailings ManagementÃ¢ÂÂ reflects our commitment to safe and responsible management throughout the TSF lifecycle and applies to South32 operated TSFs. Our overarching approach to tailings management is to achieve stable and dense tailings. This involves understanding tailings behaviour, reducing water content at TSFs, and developing innovative construction techniques for these TSFs. We actively look at how we can apply innovative solutions to improve how we manage tailings. We conduct risk assessments at each of our operated TSFs and associated major projects for material risks.\n\nOur approach to tailings management is consistent with the ICMM Tailings Management: Good Practice Guide, which is informed by the requirements of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) and the commitments in the ICMMÃ¢ÂÂs Tailings Governance Framework Position Statement, the Australian National Committee on Large Dams (ANCOLD) guidelines, as well as the ICMM Mining Principles. Meeting the requirements of the GISTM is a key focus for South32 and we actively support improvements in tailings management through the ICMM Tailings Working Group, industry conferences and research projects.",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Tailings (page 74-77)
25,,,"12.6 Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle","Trust and transparency are essential to the way we operate. We seek to build trust in the communities where we operate to help realise the potential of their resources, and we work with our suppliers and customers to apply responsible business practices throughout our value chain. Our Sustainability Policy reaffirms our commitment to sustainable development and outlines our commitment to governance and transparency on sustainability matters.\n\nWe are committed to transparently reporting our sustainability performance, in line with our Sustainability Policy and the ICMM Mining Principle 1 Ã¢ÂÂ Ethical Business. Transparency in disclosing our sustainability performance and progress is essential to build trust and demonstrate delivery on our commitments. Our 2023 Sustainable Development Report explains how our business-wide processes support our sustainability commitments, how we manage our most important sustainability topics, and the progress we have made during FY23.\n\nWe undertake annual sustainability materiality assessments to proactively anticipate, identify and assess the sustainability topics that matter most to our business and stakeholders. Our materiality assessments are guided by the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 2021. The results of the materiality assessment are used to inform the content of this report and to inform and strengthen our management of sustainability topics.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021, Recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the ICMM Mining Principles and Position Statements. In our 2023 Sustainability Databook we also demonstrate how we are pursuing alignment with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) FoundationÃ¢ÂÂs Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standard for the Metals and Mining industry. In line with our ICMM membership requirements and transparency commitments, we obtain independent assurance over selected sustainability information.\n\nWe work together with value chain partners to reduce emissions by sharing insights, enhancing monitoring and reporting, developing scalable innovation and linking performance to targets. In FY23, we developed an approach to track and influence the reduction of Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with suppliers. We continue to request customers to provide their Modern Slavery and Conflict Minerals Statements as part of our social risk due diligence activities. This is an important part of furthering transparency of sustainability performance in the value chain.",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Responsible value chain (page 57-61) \n2023 Sustainable Development Report - Our sustainability approach (page 12-18)
26,,13 Climate Action,13.1 Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries,"We completed our first physical climate risk assessments for our operations in FY18 and FY19, and updated these in FY22. The high-level themes that emerged across our operations relate to land and terrain, physical assets and infrastructure, water and transport routes. In FY23, we commenced incorporating the outcomes of our FY22 physical impacts of climate change assessment into our material risk reviews, where physical impacts of climate change were identified as a potential influence on the nature, likelihood or impact of the risk event. The consideration of physical climate risks in the material risk reviews aims to more deeply consider the physical impacts of climate change alongside other threats or hazards, and determine how we can mitigate, transfer, accept or control the risk, inclusive of the physical impacts of climate change. Our internal material risk management standard requires that all material risks be reviewed at least every two years.",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Addressing climate change (page 87-117)
27,,,"13.2 Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning","We support the objectives of the Paris Agreement and have a long-term goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all scopes (i.e. Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. This goal recognises that we have a critical role to play in contributing to the decarbonisation of the value chain and reflects our commitment to collaborating with our suppliers, customers, joint venture partners, industry peers and other value chain partners to make a meaningful contribution to the actions and innovations required to address Scope 3 emissions. We also have a medium-term target Ã¢ÂÂ to halve our operational GHG emissions by 2035 from our FY21 baseline. Our medium-term target and long-term goal apply to our group-wide business. Separately, we have taken into account the regulatory targets, baselines, carbon budgets and other emissions-related indicators specific to each facility that are set by, or comply with, various national and sub-national regulatory schemes in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nOur advocacy on climate change is underpinned by our positions on key climate change matters. These positions inform our decision making, support our external engagement with stakeholders and guide our contributions to public policy development either directly or indirectly through our industry associations. In FY23, this included contributing to industry association formal submissions to the Australian GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs Safeguard Mechanism reforms, designed to facilitate Australia achieving its commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. Given the importance of the reforms to South32 and society, we also chose to make our own formal submissions to this process, emphasising support for reforms to the Safeguard Mechanism, key issues highlighted by industry associations and identifying specific considerations for South32.\n\nParticipation in industry associations is an important mechanism to engage and influence matters affecting South32, which complements our own advocacy on issues consistent with our purpose and strategy, including climate change. Many of the associations we are a member of actively participated in public policy development relating to climate change during FY23. Consistent with Our Approach to Industry Associations, we contributed to many of those processes as working group participants.",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Addressing climate change (page 87-117)
28,,15 Life on Land,"15.5 Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species","We recognise the importance of protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services and aim to achieve no net loss for all new projects and major expansions. It is our responsibility to minimise the impacts to the environment and to rehabilitate land disturbed by our activities.\n\nAs stewards of the lands and waters upon which South32 operate, we understand the importance of protecting the biological diversity and ecosystem services of these areas and contributing to the conservation of biodiversity through all stages of the mining lifecycle. We seek to promote regional scale outcomes that are effective and enduring with a focus on our area of influence and the broader bioregions in which we operate. \n\nWe require all operations to undertake a risk and opportunity screening exercise at least every five years, including not only direct operational aspects but also the pressures on the surrounding bioregions, which could be influenced by factors such as the physical impacts of climate change and changes in land use. In FY23 we focused on expanding implementation of the mitigation hierarchy which is intended to achieve our ambition of no net loss for all new projects and major expansions of existing projects.\n\nWe participate in working groups and other forums, including the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum, to help develop and implement global standards and initiatives to meet emerging expectations in relation to biodiversity disclosure.\n\nAt Cerro Matoso and IMC we have set aside over 1,947 hectares of land for conservation. In FY23 we increased the amount of land protected for conservation, through an additional 1,323 hectares of land, associated with lease holdings at Worsley Alumina. Conservation is focused on matters that exist under the Worsley Protected Areas Procedure with associated spatially defined protected areas. The conservation areas include riverine and riparian habitat to improve ecological linkage and habitat continuity across the landscape, and high conservation value areas.\n\nAt Cerro Matoso, we have an ongoing ecological restoration program with local communities. The program, which has over 240 members, supports the restoration and conservation of native flora and fauna species in the Cordoba region of Colombia. As of December 2022, over 58,000 native plants have been planted on 291 hectares of land, previously degraded by agricultural activity, with plans in place to undertake similar restoration activity on an additional 973 hectares of degraded land. The program supports nursery activities to grow trees, with community members also helping with sowing activities. It has led to wider socio-economic benefits, with the establishment of local companies to provide Cerro Matoso with forestry services.\n\nAt IMC we continue to monitor offset stewardship sites and are working on installing nest boxes to provide supplementary habitat for species in rehabilitated areas, as well as the installation of bee hotels. These hotels have been installed in the Hairy Geebung (Persoonia hirsute) offset area and provide habitat for native solitary bees that commonly pollinate the Hairy Geebung. IMC and Symbio Wildlife Park launched a new three-year partnership in FY23 to help support koala conservation in the Illawarra and Macarthur regions of New South Wales. The Illawarra and Macarthur regions have some of the most genetically pure koalas in Australia and this new partnership directly enables important conservation measures to be fast-tracked.",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Biodiversity (page 68-73)
