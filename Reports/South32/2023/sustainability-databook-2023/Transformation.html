      <td>Transformation in South Africa has a very specific meaning. It refers to change that enables Black People to participate meaningfully in the economy by owning, managing, and controlling productive assets. The government of South Africa has passed legislation to help redress the country’s historical socio-economic inequalities. This legislation includes the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Act (B-BBEE) and the Mining Charter of 2018. We report annually on our progress against targets in the B-BBEE codes and in the Mining Charter and submit our reports to the BEE Commission and the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy. Our purpose aligns with South Africa’s transformation imperative and our operations in South Africa have a transformation plan, focused on achieving year-on-year improvements in line with legislation. Helping to transform South Africa means transforming our business too and to do this we focus on finding local talent, using local suppliers, and providing local business opportunities. Metalloys has been in care and maintenance during the reporting period but continues to track procurement spend and will undergo the Black Economic Empowerment verification audit like our other South African entities.</td>
