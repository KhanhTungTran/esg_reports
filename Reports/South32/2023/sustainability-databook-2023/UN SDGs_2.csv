Our Innovate32 program aims to create value through innovation, with the Next Generation Mine mission to reshape the way we operate and the Low Footprint mission to reduce our impact on the environment. Many of these options are being investigated through several collaborative initiatives, and our work in these areas is expected to influence our business, strategy and financial planning in future. In FY23, we participated in a number of Heavy Industry Low-Carbon Transition Cooperative Research Centre (HILT CRC) projects, covering topics such as decarbonising alumina calcination, the use of mechanical vapour recompression and storage technologies for Bayer steam generation, green heat for industries and regulatory implications, and emissions profiling. \n\nNear-term decarbonisation initiatives at Hillside Aluminium are focused on reducing energy consumption with the use of energy efficiency technology. For example, in FY22 Hillside Aluminium completed a trial of the AP3XLE energy efficiency technology and committed approximately US$18 million to deploy the technology through to FY28. We also continue to investigate and assess additional emissions reduction projects and technologies, such as inert anodes and anode coating technology.\n\nIn FY23 we completed two circular economy pilot studies at Worsley Alumina and Mozal Aluminium. The site-specific Pilots staged approach included establishing the baseline, quantitative analysis, workshop and site visits to deliver Circularity Roadmaps. \n\nThe safe management of tailings storage facilities (TSFs) is an integral part of mining and processing activities. Increased efficiency of processing technologies over time allows some of our operations to recover or recycle economically viable historical tailings materials. Our total tailings recycled has increased by five per cent in FY23 compared to the prior year due to the inclusion of tailings reused in our revised calculations. We are participating in studies for the Hermosa project to assess the retreatment of tailings during the lifecycle of the project as new technologies emerge. We actively look at how we can apply innovative solutions to improve how we manage tailings. \n\nThis year we have furthered our closure vision and planning processes and continue to work on integrating biodiversity and rehabilitation management into closure planning. Detailed closure engineering studies have begun for operations with less than 10 years before their expected closure date. The studies examine post-mining land uses, current infrastructure and land use, remediation and rehabilitation, and an assessment of the socioeconomic impact on communities.","2023 Sustainable Development Report - Tailings (page 74-77)\n2023 Sustainable Development Report - Waste, contamination and other emissions (page 78-82)\n2023 Sustainable Development Report - Closure (page 83-86)\n2023 Sustainable Development Report - Addressing climate change (page 87-117)"

20,,12 Responsible consumption and production,"12.2 By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources","Water\n\nWater is a valuable resource that we share and is critical to the sustainability of communities, the environment and our business. In many of the areas where we operate, water is scarce, and we manage risks associated with water security and access for our operations and communities. We are taking near and long-term action to minimise and, where possible, avoid any negative impacts on water availability and quality for the future of our business, local communities, and the environment.\n\nWe recognise that water is a vital shared resource with high social, cultural, spiritual, environmental, and economic value. Access to safe drinking water is an internationally recognised human right, essential to the wellbeing and livelihoods of communities. Access to water is integral to the healthy functioning of natural ecosystems and the cultural and spiritual practices of many communities. We have a role to play in, where possible, avoiding and minimising adverse impacts on water availability and quality.\n\nWater is a critical input for our operations where it is primarily used for processing, suppressing dust and managing tailings, as well as for sanitation and catering for our people. Our Approach to Water Stewardship aims to work towards sustainably managing water resources within our operations and contributing to addressing the shared water challenges in the catchments where we operate. As part of our Approach to Water Stewardship, we are committed to working with our communities by supporting local communities and working with them on community water issues they may face, now and in the future.\n\nAll operations and major projects undertake water monitoring programs within their area of influence. These programs are designed to inform us of changes in ground and surface water quality and flow rates. Local regulatory authorities set compliance requirements through our permits and licences, which are managed through monitoring programs, impact and risk assessments. Where possible, we seek to reuse or recycle to limit our reliance on shared water sources in the catchments where we operate.\n\nEach year we reassess which of our operations are exposed to baseline water stress, using the World Resources InstituteÃ¢ÂÂs Aqueduct tool, supplemented by an assessment of local context and catchment conditions.\n\nThis year we embedded our Ã¢ÂÂvalue of waterÃ¢ÂÂ project, established in FY22, to improve our long-term water planning. This provides planners with a more holistic and risk-based view of water-related planning to improve decision making and investment planning. To further strengthen our business planning processes, we enhanced our water supply and demand forecasts considering the risks and opportunities that relate to the future water profile at each of our operations and projects.\n",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Water (page 63-67)

It is our responsibility to minimise the impacts to the environment and to rehabilitate land disturbed by our activities.\n\nAs stewards of the lands and waters upon which South32 operate, we understand the importance of protecting the biological diversity and ecosystem services of these areas and contributing to the conservation of biodiversity through all stages of the mining lifecycle. We seek to promote regional scale outcomes that are effective and enduring with a focus on our area of influence and the broader bioregions in which we operate. \n\nWe require all operations to undertake a risk and opportunity screening exercise at least every five years, including not only direct operational aspects but also the pressures on the surrounding bioregions, which could be influenced by factors such as the physical impacts of climate change and changes in land use. In FY23 we focused on expanding implementation of the mitigation hierarchy which is intended to achieve our ambition of no net loss for all new projects and major expansions of existing projects.\n\nWe participate in working groups and other forums, including the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum, to help develop and implement global standards and initiatives to meet emerging expectations in relation to biodiversity disclosure.\n\nThis year we have furthered our closure vision and planning processes and continue to work on integrating biodiversity and rehabilitation management into closure planning.",2023 Sustainable Development Report - Biodiversity (page 68-73)\n2023 Sustainable Development Report - Closure (page 83-86)
22,,,,"Waste, contamination and other emissions\n\nReducing waste generated from our operations is a key part of our commitment to continuously improving our sustainability performance. We manage waste in line with the ICMM Mining Principles: 2 Ã¢ÂÂ Decision Making, 4 Ã¢ÂÂ Risk Management, 6 Ã¢ÂÂ Environmental Performance and 8 Ã¢ÂÂ Responsible Production, and apply the mitigation hierarchy that limits waste production and prioritises waste prevention, followed by minimisation, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and disposal.\n\nOur internal standard outlines the requirements that operations use a waste register to improve the way they identify, assess, quantify and report risks and opportunities associated with all their waste streams. All our operations are required to maintain an updated contamination register outlining the location of all known contamination as well as a description of the history of the originating event, control actions and remediation details. As part of our continuous improvement, this year we updated our waste-related performance requirements in our internal environmental and climate change standard to strengthen waste management across our operations. All operations are required to complete a self-assessment against the requirements of the internal standard and complete agreed action plans to close any identified gaps.\n\nCareful segregation and containment of waste provides the opportunity for material to be recovered and beneficially used in the future as the national and international circular economy matures. In FY23 we completed two circular economy pilot studies at Worsley Alumina and Mozal Aluminium.\n\nOther air emissions refer to non-greenhouse gas air emissions from our operations such as sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulates (including dust), odour, vibration, light and noise. Our approach to managing other air emissions considers the acute, incremental and cumulative impacts of other air emissions on sensitive receptors, including communities located within the relevant airshed.","2023 Sustainable Development Report - Waste, contamination and other emissions (page 78-82)"
