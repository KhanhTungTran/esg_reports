,"(1) Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions are reported in accordance with the methodologies disclosed in the 'Emissions methodology' tab. 
(2) In accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 disclosure requirements, our location-based Scope 2 GHG emissions were 19.7 Mt CO2-e, which is 8.3 Mt CO2-e higher than our market-based emissions in FY23. Location-based Scope 2 emissions are calculated using a country grid emission factor based on the location in which the energy consumption occurs, while market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions are calculated using an emissions factor associated with purchased electricity. Residual mix emissions factors (i.e. the emissions factor of all untracked and unclaimed electricity in a market) are not published in the regions where we operate, so a location-based factor is used for electricity purchased that does not have an associated supplier-specific emissions factor. This will result in some double counting of renewable and/or low emissions electricity. The difference between Scope 2 location-based and market-based emissions is associated with our purchase of hydroelectric power at Mozal Aluminium.
(3) FY21 adjusted Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions excluding South Africa Energy Coal (SAEC) and Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Company (TEMCO) are 20.7 Mt CO2-e. 
(4) FY21 adjusted Scope 3 GHG emissions excluding SAEC and TEMCO are 61.5 Mt CO2-e.",,,,,,,,,,,

(2) Scope 1 covered emissions are defined as scope 1 emissions, including direct emissions from fugitive emissions and emissions from fuel combustion and industrial process. Scope 1 covered emissions may differ slightly to the disclosed Facility level emissions due to difference in reporting boundaries as per the NGER Act.  ",,,,,,,,,,,
