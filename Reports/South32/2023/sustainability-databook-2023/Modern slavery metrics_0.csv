3,,MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT METRICS,,,,,
5,,"As a company with a large and complex global supply chain and business activities across Australia, Southern Africa and the Americas, we recognise that modern slavery is a risk. We are committed to respecting human rights and taking meaningful action against modern slavery. Not only is this the right thing to do and central to our purpose and values, but it is critical to the integrity and success of our business. Eliminating modern slavery risks from our operations and supply chain requires collaboration and we work closely with our stakeholders to continually evolve our approach. Modern slavery is not acceptable in our operations or supply chains. Our annual Modern Slavery Statement, available at www.south32.net, outlines our approach to continue to reduce the risk of modern slavery in our operations and our supply chains.",,,,,
