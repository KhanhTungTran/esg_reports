41,,"3. Indicates estimated emissions arising from the operation of a black water treatment plant at ANZÃ¢ÂÂs Global Headquarters in Melbourne, Australia. 4. Scope 3 emissions from our lending (Ã¢ÂÂportfolio emissionsÃ¢ÂÂ) are not included in the boundary of the carbon neutral assessment as this assessment scope is limited to ANZÃ¢ÂÂs operations. To reduce our portfolio emissions, we are transitioning our lending in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We are applying emerging tools used by peer banks to measure and compare our efforts in reducing emissions, including how we can report on the impact of our lending decisions. For further information on our financed emissions, please refer to the metrics and targets section of our Climate-related Financial Disclosures, available here: https://www.anz.com.au/about-us/esg/reporting/esg-reporting/ 5. Represents employee commuting emissions from staff working in key commercial office locations in Australia and New Zealand. 6. Comparisons with previous years' figures must be viewed with caution due to different methodology. 7. From 2021 includes global water emissions values, 2018 Ã¢ÂÂ 2020 values include Australia only. 8. Emissions associated with increased home energy use from heating/cooling, lighting, equipment electricity and fuel use as a result of the shift of Australian and New Zealand staff from working out of offices, to working from home. This was calculated and externally assured for the first time in 2021. 9. Data available for the first time in 2023. 10. Capital goods include embodied carbon of new branch fit outs in Australia, and laptop purchases in New Zealand. Emissions from fit out embodied carbon have been extrapolated using an assessment of one Breathe designed retail branch. The stages of emissions calculated in this assessment are from the Raw Material Supply, Transport and Manufacturing (A1-A3) for one Breathe designed retail branch. Construction Phase (A4-A5) has not been calculated due to unreliable data sources. Currently New Zealand is the only country where ANZ purchase laptops for staff. In other countries, laptops and associated IT equipment are leased. 11. Carbon offsets for ANZ's global business operations have been retired in accordance with The Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard and externally assured. 12. ANZ has retired carbon offsets for its business operations since 2010. 2020 was the first year ANZ adopted the market-based reporting method to account for purposefully purchased renewable energy attributes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
