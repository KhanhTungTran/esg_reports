Scope:\n\nIn conducting our Impact Analysis work this year, we have identified our most significant impact areas using aspects of the UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking Ã¢ÂÂ Impact Analysis Tool. In analysing our impact, we considered our Retail, Commercial and Institutional businesses across our main markets of operation, Australia and New Zealand. We considered material sectors financed across each business area.\n\nWe also conducted our annual materiality assessment to seek to ensure our targets and commitments reflect the most significant ESG risks and opportunities facing our business and the communities in which we operate. This materiality review considers ESG issues that impact society, the environment and ANZÃ¢ÂÂs ability to create value. The results help inform our strategy, business practices - including group remuneration scorecard - ESG targets and external reporting.\n\nb. Portfolio composition:\n\nWe considered the distribution of our portfolio across geographies and business segments in the impact analysis completed through the Impact Analysis Tool:\n\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\tGeography: Around 88% of our lending assets is provided in Australia and New Zealand. Other international lending is through our Institutional bank which covers Asia, Pacific, Europe, America and the Middle East.\n\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\tMajor industry type: The following breakdown shows credit risk exposures at default (EAD) as at 30 September 2022 by major industry type:\nÃ¢ÂÂ Personal Ã¢ÂÂ 38%\nÃ¢ÂÂ Financial, Investments & Insurance Ã¢ÂÂ 29%\t\nÃ¢ÂÂ Government and Official Institutions Ã¢ÂÂ 6%\nÃ¢ÂÂ Property Services Ã¢ÂÂ 6%\nÃ¢ÂÂ Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Mining Ã¢ÂÂ 4%\nÃ¢ÂÂ Manufacturing Ã¢ÂÂ 4%\nÃ¢ÂÂ Wholesale Trade Ã¢ÂÂ 3%\nÃ¢ÂÂ Electricity, Gas & Water supply Ã¢ÂÂ 2%\nÃ¢ÂÂ Retail Trade Ã¢ÂÂ 2%\nÃ¢ÂÂ Transport & Storage Ã¢ÂÂ 2%\nÃ¢ÂÂ Business Services Ã¢ÂÂ 1%\nÃ¢ÂÂ Construction Ã¢ÂÂ 1%\nÃ¢ÂÂ Other Ã¢ÂÂ 2%\n\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\tPortfolio breakdown by segment: Institutional Banking (29%), Commercial Banking (14%), Retail Banking (57%).",,Our materiality assessment,,,

25,,,,,"\ne. Performance measurement:\n\nClimate stability (Environmental sustainability)\n\nThe most important role we can play in meeting the Paris Agreement goals is to help our customers reduce emissions and enhance their resilience to a changing climate. We support an orderly transition that recognises and responds to social impacts. This aligns with our purpose to shape a world in which people and communities thrive.\n\nOur Environmental Sustainability strategy identifies priority sectors, technologies and financing opportunities to help achieve our ambition. Our Climate Change Commitment provides the framework to achieve our strategy of transitioning our lending in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. \n\nWe were the first Australian bank to join the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in 2021, reflecting these commitments. That same year, we set 2030 targets for carbon intensive sectors for large-scale commercial real estate in Australia and global power generation. In 2022, we set additional 2030 targets for carbon intensive sectors for oil and gas and building materials: cement, aluminium and steel. This year, we added new targets for thermal coal and three transport sub-sectors Ã¢ÂÂ auto-manufacturing, airlines, and shipping. We aim to progressively expand our coverage of key sectors up to the end 2024, in line with our NZBA commitment and the evolution of globally recognised standards and methodologies. We expect that by end 2024 we will have established pathways and targets for up to nine sectors representing at least 75% of our financed emissions.\n\nOur sectoral decarbonisation targets sit alongside an additional target to fund and facilitate at least A$100 billion by end 2030, including A$15 billion by end 2024, in social and environmental outcomes through customer activities and direct investments by ANZ. This includes initiatives that help lower carbon emissions, protect nature and biodiversity, increase access to affordable housing and promote financial wellbeing. We also have targets to enhance our management of climate risks and opportunities by intensifying our engagement with our largest emitting business customers (large emitters engagement program) and reduce our operational footprint focused on carbon emissions, renewable energy, water and paper consumption, and waste. \n\nAvailability, accessibility, affordability, quality of resources & services (Housing) \n\nWe seek to play a role in helping to improve the availability of suitable and affordable housing. We provide support for innovative housing delivery models across the private, public and not-for-profit sectors, through research and market expertise, and through our partnerships with community organisations. \n\nWe aim to help improve the availability of suitable and affordable housing options for all Australians and New Zealanders by increasing the supply of social and affordable housing; investing in emerging markets such as build-to-rent, specialist disability accommodation and land lease housing; and backing new housing models from pilot to scale including build-to-rent-to-own. \n\nWe have a target to fund and facilitate at least A$10 billion of investment by end 2030, including A$750 million by end 2024, to deliver homes to buy and rent that are more affordable, accessible or sustainable in Australia and New Zealand. \n\n",,,,,

Beyond providing core banking services, we play a key role in leading research into what is influencing financial wellbeing in Australia and New Zealand. Insights from our research are shared publicly so they can be used by government, community and corporate sectors to inform their work, and we use these insights to inform our products and services, as well as our financial education programs, Saver Plus and MoneyMinded.
