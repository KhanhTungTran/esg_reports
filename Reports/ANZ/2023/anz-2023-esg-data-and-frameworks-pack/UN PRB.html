Performance measurement:\n\nClimate stability (Environmental sustainability)\n\nThe most important role we can play in meeting the Paris Agreement goals is to help our customers reduce emissions and enhance their resilience to a changing climate. We support an orderly transition that recognises and responds to social impacts. This aligns with our purpose to shape a world in which people and communities thrive.\n\nOur Environmental Sustainability strategy identifies priority sectors, technologies and financing opportunities to help achieve our ambition. Our Climate Change Commitment provides the framework to achieve our strategy of transitioning our lending in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. \n\nWe were the first Australian bank to join the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in 2021, reflecting these commitments. That same year, we set 2030 targets for carbon intensive sectors for large-scale commercial real estate in Australia and global power generation. In 2022, we set additional 2030 targets for carbon intensive sectors for oil and gas and building materials: cement, aluminium and steel. This year, we added new targets for thermal coal and three transport sub-sectors â auto-manufacturing, airlines, and shipping. We aim to progressively expand our coverage of key sectors up to the end 2024, in line with our NZBA commitment and the evolution of globally recognised standards and methodologies. We expect that by end 2024 we will have established pathways and targets for up to nine sectors representing at least 75% of our financed emissions.\n\nOur sectoral decarbonisation targets sit alongside an additional target to fund and facilitate at least A$100 billion by end 2030, including A$15 billion by end 2024, in social and environmental outcomes through customer activities and direct investments by ANZ. This includes initiatives that help lower carbon emissions, protect nature and biodiversity, increase access to affordable housing and promote financial wellbeing. We also have targets to enhance our management of climate risks and opportunities by intensifying our engagement with our largest emitting business customers (large emitters engagement program) and reduce our operational footprint focused on carbon emissions, renewable energy, water and paper consumption, and waste. \n\nAvailability, accessibility, affordability, quality of resources &amp; services (Housing) \n\nWe seek to play a role in helping to improve the availability of suitable and affordable housing. We provide support for innovative housing delivery models across the private, public and not-for-profit sectors, through research and market expertise, and through our partnerships with community organisations. \n\nWe aim to help improve the availability of suitable and affordable housing options for all Australians and New Zealanders by increasing the supply of social and affordable housing; investing in emerging markets such as build-to-rent, specialist disability accommodation and land lease housing; and backing new housing models from pilot to scale including build-to-rent-to-own. \n\nWe have a target to fund and facilitate at least A$10 billion of investment by end 2030, including A$750 million by end 2024, to deliver homes to buy and rent that are more affordable, accessible or sustainable in Australia and New Zealand. \n\n</td>

      <td>Social Economic Convergence (Financial wellbeing)\n\nANZ recognises the importance of financial wellbeing across the whole population in sustaining a healthy and inclusive economy. Beyond providing core banking services, we play a key role in leading research into what is influencing financial wellbeing in Australia and New Zealand. Insights from our research are shared publicly so they can be used by government, community and corporate sectors to inform their work, and we use these insights to inform our products and services, as well as our financial education programs, Saver Plus and MoneyMinded. These programs involve close collaboration with partners from the community and government sectors. \n\nIn FY23, we achieved our previous two targets:\nâ¢ 36% of ANZ Plus customers have created a savings goal (against a target of 30% or more)\nâ¢ We have established 14 new MoneyMinded partnerships since October 2020 (against a target of seven). These partnerships have enabled us to deliver MoneyMinded to more lower income people across the markets we operate in to help improve their financial wellbeing. \n\nThis year, we developed two new targets for FY24:\nâ¢ Encourage our customers to build and maintain financial resilience with the aim of having at least 2.5 million customers (From a baseline of approximately 2.4 million customers as at 30/09/2023) with a financial buffer of approximately 6 weeksâ expenses by end 2026. (Australia/New Zealand) \nâ¢ Pilot a savings program (Saver Plus) for people on lower incomes in Fiji and Vanuatu by end 2025, with at least 80% of participants having demonstrated a savings habit (2. 8 out of 10 months saving (as per Saver Plus program), measured by participant survey data) upon completion (Pacific). \n\nMore information on all our ESG targets and performance can be found on pages 15-20 of the 2023 ESG Supplement and pages 81-82 of the 2023 Climate-related Financial Disclosures.</td>

      <td>Climate stability (Environmental sustainability)\n\nOur Climate Change Commitment provides the framework to achieve our strategy of transitioning our lending in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Our Commitment is centred on four focus areas:\n\n1. Supporting our customers and industries to transition\n2. Transitioning our lending to net zero financed emissions by 2050 in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement\n3. Engaging constructively and transparently with stakeholders\n4. Reducing emissions from our operations\n\nOne of our new ESG targets is to fund and facilitate at least A$100 billion by 2030, including A$15 billion by end 2024, in social and environmental outcomes for our customers. Key to this are our sustainable finance products and service. Since April 2023 we have participated in 54 transactions and funding/facilitating ~A$8.8 billion towards the target.\n\nAnother ESG target is to enhance our management of climate risks and opportunities by intensifying our engagement with our largest emitting business customers. We will expect and encourage them to strengthen their low carbon transition plans, by: \nâ¢ focusing our engagement and raised expectations on our 100 largest emitting customers with the aim that by end 2025, compared to their starting point more customers achieve a âwell developedâ or âadvancedâ rating for their low carbon transition plans; and\nâ¢ extending the use of our Climate Change Risk Assessment methodology so that by end 2024 it has been used to support our engagement with the revised list of our 100 largest emitting customers.\n\nFurther details around implementation and progress on these targets is provided in the Climate-related Financial Disclosures report available at anz.com/esgeport.\n\nAvailability, accessibility, affordability, quality of resources &amp; services (Housing)\nAnother important focus for ANZ is supporting household, business and financial practices that improve environmental sustainability.\n\nIn 2023, ANZ continued to support New Zealanders looking to combat rising energy and fuel costs and improve the environmental sustainability of their homes, encouraging better housing standards for both owner occupiers and renters through: \n\nâ¢ Our Healthy Home Loan package offers interest rate discounts and fee savings for eligible customers who are buying, building, renovating or already own a home with a 6 Homestar rating or higher. \nâ¢ Our Good Energy Home Loan top up is available to existing eligible home loan customers to upgrade their homes with solar panels, heating and insulation, double glazing, ventilation systems or rainwater tanks. It can also be used for electric and hybrid vehicles, electric bikes, and electric vehicle chargers. It allows customers to borrow up to NZ$80,000 at a 3-year fixed interest rate of 1% per annum. \n\nSince October 2020 we have supported 9,482 households into healthier homes and drawn down NZ$379.09m \n\nMore information on all our ESG targets and performance can be found on pages 15-20 of the 2023 ESG Supplement and pages 81-82 of the 2023 Climate-related Financial Disclosures.</td>

It incorporates our approach to human rights, including our âzero toleranceâ for land acquisition and involuntary resettlement that we consider improper, as well as labour rights issues such as modern slavery.\n\nWe review the Policy at least every three years, with oversight from our ERBC to ensure it remains fit-for-purpose. The review takes into account changes to customer practices, international standards, emerging social and environmental issues, and stakeholder feedback.\n\nOUr Human Rights Grievance Mechanism is designed to promote responsible business conduct, under a framework through which:\nâ¢ efforts can be made to resolve grievances; and\nâ¢ recommendations aimed at strengthening our due diligence processes can be provided.</td>
