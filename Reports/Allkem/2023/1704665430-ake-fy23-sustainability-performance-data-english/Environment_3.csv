517,"2. Allkem's Salar de Olaroz Mining Operation is located in The Salar de Olaroz in the province of Jujuy, Argentina (latitude: -23.55, longitude:-66.75). Part of the site is located within the Olaroz-Cauchari Reserve, which was created in 1981 as a multiple-use area, with the purpose of preserving biodiversity, specifically the protection of VicuÃÂ±as (Vicugna vicugna). Agricultural, mining and scientific-technical research programs can be carried out in this area. We work with local communities to monitor the region's biodiversity through our sustainable vicuÃÂ±a management program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

519,"4. Sal de Vida Project is located within the Salar del Hombre Muerto, in the province of Catamarca, Argentina (latitude:-25.42, longitude: -66.89). In accordance with IFC's ND6 (2012) criteria for determining the presence of critical habitats, several species were identified that meet Criteria 2 and/or 3 thresholds to trigger a Critical Habitat (CH): the Andean Flamingo, Horned Coot, Liolaemus vulcanus, and Liolaemus kunza. In addition, the Project overlaps with the Salar de Hombre Muerto Key Biodiversity Area",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
520,"5. James Bay Project is Located in northern QuÃÂ©bec, approximately 130 km east of James Bay and the Cree Nation of Eastmain community (latitude: 52.24, longitude: -77.07). The project is still in design and permitting stage, with no operational activities on site. The area was mapped for biodiversity and monitoring programs and procedure for fauna, flora and land use are being developed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
