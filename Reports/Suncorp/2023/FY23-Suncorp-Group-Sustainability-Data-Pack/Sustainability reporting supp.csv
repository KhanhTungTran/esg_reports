The data is reviewed annually based on the most recent emissions data.  Investments’ FY23 progress report is based on the reduction of exposures to companies involved in thermal coal extraction and electricity generation and the reduction in exposures to the highest carbon emitters and most carbon intensive emitters in the O&G E&P companies.  The identified companies are incorporated into in Suncorp’s exclusions list which is reviewed annually.

(This has since moved to 10% as of 1 July 2023.)

For progress in oil and gas, the key metric is based on a companies' carbon intensity from Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (the unit of measurement is metric tonne of CO2-e per million of USD revenue), with the Top 25% are excluded. In addition, we also rank the companies by absolute emissions from Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (the unit of measurement is metric tonne of CO2-e) and exclude the top 25%.

",Analysis was supported by third party data including the Sustainalytics carbon database at March 2023.,"Scope 1 and 2 emissions are currently used as this ensures reliability and availability across entities in the Suncorp benchmarks.
