7,,Financial,Subscriber numbers,,,,,
8,,,"Each unique subscription to a Xero-offered product that is purchased by a user (e.g. small business or accounting partner) and which is, or is available to be, deployed.

10,,,Average revenue per user (ARPU) ($),,,,,

16,,,Churn (%),,,,,

19,,,Lifetime value (LTV) per subscriber,,,,,
20,,,"Is the gross margin expected from a subscriber over the lifetime of that subscriber.\n\nThis is calculated by taking the average subscriber lifetime (one divided by churn), multiplied by ARPU, multiplied by the gross margin percentage. Xero Group LTV is calculated as the sum of the individual segment LTV, multiplied by their respective segment subscribers, divided by total Xero Group subscribers.",,,,,
22,,,LTV/CAC,,,,,
23,,,"Is the ratio between the LTV per subscriber and the cost to acquire that subscriber. For example, the LTV derived from a subscriber is currently on average 6.5 times the cost of acquiring that subscriber.\n\nXero strives to maximise total LTV while optimising the level of CAC investment it undertakes in order to achieve a desirable LTV/ CAC ratio. Xero can improve total LTV in multiple ways, such as increasing subscriber numbers, enhancing products and services for existing subscribers thereby increasing ARPU and/or reducing churn, and improving gross margin through cost efficiencies.",,,,,
