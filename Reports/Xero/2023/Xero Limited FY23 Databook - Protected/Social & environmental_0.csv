Due to differences in Climate Active Technical guidance and Science Based Target Net Zero guidance, we are transitioning to reporting a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol aligned inventory in our annual reporting suite. This inventory will be used to report our progress against our 2030 emissions reduction targets. Our Climate Active inventory will continue to be provided in our annual Climate Active public disclosure summary available on the Australian GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs Climate Active website. As a result FY22 and FY21 have also been adjusted to align with the GHG protocol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
