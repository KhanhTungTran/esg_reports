202,,2 Offsets attributable to FY22 were surrendered during FY23. This is a result of the Climate Transition Plan being released after the FY22 reporting period had finished.,,,,,,,,,,
203,,"3 Where there has been no voluntary surrender of LGCs, there will be minor differences in the Scope 2 emissions value calculated between the location-based and market-based methods. This is in part is due to the residual mix factor being applied at a national level rather than on a state-by-state basis. Where this is the case i.e., there has been no voluntary surrender of LGCs, we assume the location-based method calculation value also represents the market-based method calculation value. APA has not surrendered LGCs for electricity transmission line losses in the reporting period.",,,,,,,,,,
