2,,Sustainability Data Book Basis of Preparation (BoP),,,,,,,
4,,"This section details the basis on which the quantitative metrics in this APA FY23 Sustainability Data Book were developed. \nUnless otherwise stated the reporting period is 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023.\nUnless otherwise stated, the data only covers the performance and activities over which APA Group maintains operational control. This includes APA GroupÃ¢ÂÂs wholly owned and operated assets, assets with an equity interest where APA maintains operational control, and the operational aspects of non-APA assets where we maintained operational control during the reporting period. Orbost Gas Processing Plant was sold in July 2022.\nFor the purposes of emissions and energy reporting, APA does not have operational control of Gruyere Power Station, Gruyere Solar Farm, X41 and North Brown Hill Wind Farm. \nUnless otherwise stated, it does not include performance data on assets in which APA maintains an equity share but no operational control.\nUnless otherwise stated, all currency and payment figures are reported in Australian dollars (AUD) or millions of Australian dollars (AUD $m).\nUnless required to be displayed as a decimal, numbers and percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number.\nThe quantitative metrics in this FY23 Sustainability Data Book were prepared and internally verified by the relevant subject matter experts, and then reviewed and verified by senior managers and APA executives prior to Board approval.\nThe reporting indicators included in this FY23 Sustainability Data Book were collated from various international reporting initiatives and frameworks, and were determined in terms of relevance to the business activities of APA Group. These included: the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Index; the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); and APA GroupÃ¢ÂÂs internal and external reporting requirements. APAÃ¢ÂÂs alignment with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) will be available in APAÃ¢ÂÂs new Climate Report and Climate Data Book, September 2023.\nAPA Group aims to achieve reporting sustainability information that is comparable year on year and with our peers and industry benchmarks. We aim to ensure this information is reliable and meets internal and external stakeholder expectations. Any restatements or repositioned data from previous financial years, relating to this FY23 Sustainability Data Book, is outlined as a footnote in this Data Book and if applicable.\n",,,,,,,
