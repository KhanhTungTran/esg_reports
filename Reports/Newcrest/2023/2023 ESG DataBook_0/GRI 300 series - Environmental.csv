,,"(1) The ICMM water reporting guide specifies two water quality categories: High quality and Low quality. High quality typically has high socio-environmental value with multiple beneficial uses and/or receptors. Low quality may typically have lower socio‑environmental value as the poorer quality may restrict potential suitability for use by a wide range of other users/receptors.
Newcrest refers to both the MCA Water Accounting Framework (WAF) and the ICMM reporting guide to categorise water quality. ICMM’s ‘High quality’ is consistent with category 1 and 2 of the MCA WAF, and ICMM’s ‘Low quality’ is consistent with Category 3 of the MCA WAF (refer to p.35 of the ICMM (2021) Water Reporting: Good practice guide, 2nd Edition).
(2) Wafi-Golpu data is presented however not included in Company totals as it is not under Newcrest’s operational control. 
(3) Brucejack Lake withdrawal has been reclassified from Category 1 in FY22 to Category 2 in FY23 in line with water quality.  
(4) Cadia abstraction volumes exclude storage facility releases (spillway and ecological flow).The water quality categorisation and the Water Accounting Framework have been revised in accordance with the ICMM (2021) Water Reporting Good Practice Guide, 2nd Edition. At Cadia, Category 3 surface water and groundwater classified in FY22 has been reclassified as Category 2 in FY23.
(5) Operation is located in an area of high water stress as categorised by the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. For further information go to www.wri.org/aqueduct. Lihir was previously classified as extremely high due to the interannual variability of water supply (for example, from climate), as well as the broader area’s lack of accessibility to improved sanitation and safe drinking water however the current risk rating states ‘no data’. Telfer/Havieron is classified as high due to the interannual variability of water supply (for example, groundwater recharge rates from variable rainfall). Cadia is classified as low-medium and Red Chris and Brucejack are classified as low water risk area. Appaloosa (Exploration site) is rated as medium-high. Wafi-Golpu is rated as medium-high.
(6) Seawater abstraction at Lihir is not introduced into the processing circuit for the purpose of ore processing. At Lihir, there was a reduction in water withdrawal in FY23 compared to FY22 due to extensive period (approximately 8 months) of very low rainfall.
(7) At Red Chris, Category 3 water (for pit dewatering) classified as Produced Water in FY22 has been reclassified as 'Groundwater' in FY23 in line with ICMM guidance.
(8) MCA WAF categories include: Category 1 – water that is close to the drinking water standards, as it only requires minimum treatment (disinfection) to be safe for human consumption. Category 1 water may be used for all purposes. Category 2 – water that is suitable for a range of purposes, subject to appropriate treatment to remove total dissolved solids and/or to adjust other parameters to be safe for human consumption and more sensitive agricultural and recreational purposes. Category 3 – low quality water which requires significant treatment to raise quality to appropriate drinking water standards.

,,"(1) Emissions from the Cadia UG vent rises have been included for the first time in FY23.
(2) Lihir’s relatively higher air emissions can be attributed to the use of heavy fuel oils in electricity generation on-site.
(3) Port Hedland’s air emissions are largely due to the inclusion of ships used by Newcrest berthed at Port Hedland.
(4) Port Hedland and Cadia Dewatering are included consistent with National Pollutant Inventory reporting requirements. Not applicable for Exploration and Corporate.

,,"(1) Wafi-Golpu data is presented however not included in Company totals as it is not under Newcrest's operational control.
(2) Land held for ancillary purposes at Cadia includes biodiversity offset areas.
(3) The area of seafloor potentially disturbed within Lihir’s lease (260ha) is included based on the GRI definition for MM1 (that includes consideration of the seafloor in land that is owned or leased and may be disturbed by mine activities). The reported area is a conservative estimate that includes all of the seabed within the mine lease boundary. Newcrest also conducts oceanographic surveys to monitor the distribution of waste rock placement, deep sea tailings placement and dilute plumes (that may extend outside the extent defined by MM1) aligned with the Lihir regulatory approved Environmental Management and Monitoring Program and the mine Environmental Impact Statement. 
(4) Exploration data will vary year to year. This reflects the changes to the Exploration portfolio while Newcrest is in growth phase as a company. ‘Near mine’ exploration data has been included in the operating sites rather than as part of ‘Exploration’.
(5) In some instances, opening land disturbed balances do not align with prior year closing land disturbed balances due to improved data quality.
