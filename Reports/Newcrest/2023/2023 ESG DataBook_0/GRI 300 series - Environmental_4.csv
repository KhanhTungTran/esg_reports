347,,,"(1) Wafi-Golpu data is presented however not included in Company totals as it is not under Newcrest's operational control.\n(2) Land held for ancillary purposes at Cadia includes biodiversity offset areas.\n(3) The area of seafloor potentially disturbed within LihirÃ¢ÂÂs lease (260ha) is included based on the GRI definition for MM1 (that includes consideration of the seafloor in land that is owned or leased and may be disturbed by mine activities). The reported area is a conservative estimate that includes all of the seabed within the mine lease boundary. Newcrest also conducts oceanographic surveys to monitor the distribution of waste rock placement, deep sea tailings placement and dilute plumes (that may extend outside the extent defined by MM1) aligned with the Lihir regulatory approved Environmental Management and Monitoring Program and the mine Environmental Impact Statement. \n(4) Exploration data will vary year to year. This reflects the changes to the Exploration portfolio while Newcrest is in growth phase as a company. Ã¢ÂÂNear mineÃ¢ÂÂ exploration data has been included in the operating sites rather than as part of Ã¢ÂÂExplorationÃ¢ÂÂ.\n(5) In some instances, opening land disturbed balances do not align with prior year closing land disturbed balances due to improved data quality. \nNote to reader: Total land area (iv)= (D)+(i)+(ii)+(iii).
