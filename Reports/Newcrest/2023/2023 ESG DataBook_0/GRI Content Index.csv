Defining Materiality
The material sustainability topics most important to our stakeholders and our business are identified through the materiality determination process. In accordance with the GRI Standards and AccountAbility’s Five-Part Materiality Test, this involves an independent assessment of a range of directly relevant sources, including internal policy, risk and strategy documents, media, peer and industry publications, and benchmarking, as well as representative internal and external key stakeholder interviews. Newcrest manage the assessment process each year, and engage an independent external specialist to qualify the process every second year (completed in FY22).",,,,,,
