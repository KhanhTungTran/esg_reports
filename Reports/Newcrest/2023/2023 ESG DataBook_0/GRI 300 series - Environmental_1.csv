100,,,"(1) The energy consumed when our operations use self-generated electricity from fossil fuels is not included in the total energy consumption because the energy used to produce that electricity has already been accounted for. This change in approach has resulted in lower energy intensities (with no effect on emissions intensities from which we base our reduction targets). Red Chris is operated by Newcrest (70% owned), Newcrest reports 100% of emissions from sites which we operate. Brucejack data is presented FY22 however not included in Company totals as it was not under NewcrestÃ¢ÂÂs operational control for the full year.\n(2) Production of silver accounts for less than 1% of total production and is not included in the calculations for total gold equivalent.\n(3) Cadia and Telfer are reported as gold plus gold equivalent ounces based on a gold price of US$1,300/oz and a copper price of US$3/lb.\n(4) The FY19 energy intensities have been restated due to a change in approach to reporting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

134,,,"(1) The ICMM water reporting guide specifies two water quality categories: High quality and Low quality. High quality typically has high socio-environmental value with multiple beneficial uses and/or receptors. Low quality may typically have lower socioÃ¢ÂÂenvironmental value as the poorer quality may restrict potential suitability for use by a wide range of other users/receptors.\nNewcrest refers to both the MCA Water Accounting Framework (WAF) and the ICMM reporting guide to categorise water quality. ICMMÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂHigh qualityÃ¢ÂÂ is consistent with category 1 and 2 of the MCA WAF, and ICMMÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂLow qualityÃ¢ÂÂ is consistent with Category 3 of the MCA WAF (refer to p.35 of the ICMM (2021) Water Reporting: Good practice guide, 2nd Edition).\n(2) Wafi-Golpu data is presented however not included in Company totals as it is not under NewcrestÃ¢ÂÂs operational control. \n(3) Brucejack Lake withdrawal has been reclassified from Category 1 in FY22 to Category 2 in FY23 in line with water quality.Ã \n(4) Cadia abstraction volumes exclude storage facility releases (spillway and ecological flow).The water quality categorisation and the Water Accounting Framework have been revised in accordance with the ICMM (2021) Water Reporting Good Practice Guide, 2nd Edition. At Cadia, Category 3 surface water and groundwater classified in FY22 has been reclassified as Category 2 in FY23.\n(5) Operation is located in an area of high water stress as categorised by the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. For further information go to www.wri.org/aqueduct. Lihir was previously classified as extremely high due to the interannual variability of water supply (for example, from climate), as well as the broader areaÃ¢ÂÂs lack of accessibility to improved sanitation and safe drinking water however the current risk rating states Ã¢ÂÂno dataÃ¢ÂÂ. Telfer/Havieron is classified as high due to the interannual variability of water supply (for example, groundwater recharge rates from variable rainfall). Cadia is classified as low-medium and Red Chris and Brucejack are classified as low water risk area. Appaloosa (Exploration site) is rated as medium-high. Wafi-Golpu is rated as medium-high.\n(6) Seawater abstraction at Lihir is not introduced into the processing circuit for the purpose of ore processing. At Lihir, there was a reduction in water withdrawal in FY23 compared to FY22 due to extensive period (approximately 8 months)ÃÂ of very low rainfall.\n(7) At Red Chris, Category 3 water (for pit dewatering)ÃÂ classified as Produced Water in FY22 has been reclassified as 'Groundwater' in FY23 in line with ICMM guidance.\n(8) MCA WAF categories include: Category 1 Ã¢ÂÂ water that is close to the drinking water standards, as it only requires minimum treatment (disinfection) to be safe for human consumption. Category 1 water may be used for all purposes. Category 2 Ã¢ÂÂ water that is suitable for a range of purposes, subject to appropriate treatment to remove total dissolved solids and/or to adjust other parameters to be safe for human consumption and more sensitive agricultural and recreational purposes. Category 3 Ã¢ÂÂ low quality water which requires significant treatment to raise quality to appropriate drinking water standards.\nNote: Water withdrawal data was not collected from Corporate Offices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
