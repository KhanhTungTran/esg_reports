Irrespective of the gender, the employee in a position is paid the same. \n(2) Our Supplier Performance Commitments set out our expectations of our suppliers with respect to paying above the minimum wage. Where we work with third-party labour providers, including recruitment agencies, it is the responsibility of the labour supplier to ensure their employment arrangements comply with local laws applicable in the workerÃ¢ÂÂs jurisdiction and that wage arrangements meet or exceed the minimum standards set in the respective jurisdiction. We ensure through the tendering process that labour suppliers have compliance mechanisms in place to satisfy the labour requirements in their respective jurisdictions.

As the integration process continues, all ex-Pretivm employees and contractors received code of conduct training and communications pursuant to Pretivm's code. The data included in this sustainability submission relates to the delivery of Newcrest's refreshed Code of Conduct which was launched organization wide in August 2022. In addition to the delivery of the refreshed code training, there have been ongoing company wide communications (Golden News, enterprise-wide E&C updates/communications delivered by regional and site E&C leads, booklets, posters).\n(3) Newcrest identifies employee need for specific Anti-Bribery and Corruption based on an assessment of risk in the assigned role.\n(4) Where it was not possible to breakdown by grade, employees and contractors have been grouped as ""Otherwise classified"".\n(5) Our automated LMS systems, only record completion of online training courses, however we also undertake other tailored training by face to face and online/teams education and awareness sessions; we are therefore comfortable that even though our automated systems have recorded compliance statistics of less than 95%, other methods of reaching both high risk and non-high risk staff would ensure that this target was reached and exceeded. \n(6) Other means of communication and training in FY23, have included, (this is a non-exhaustive, but key list): \n\nFace to face training sessions run by our site champions and corporate teams on general matters of business integrity encompassing code of conduct, anti-bribery and corruption, gifts, hospitality and sponsored travel, conflicts of interest and privacy, fraud, donations and sponsorships, Speak Out, and due diligence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
