43,,,State the ratio of the percentage increase in annual total compensation for the organizationÃ¢ÂÂs highest-paid individual to the median percentage increase in annual total compensation for all employees (excluding the highest-paid individual).,"The highest paid individual was determined using the highest paid active employee in each year.\nThe median pay was determined finding the median total target rem and then determining the actual total rem for that individual. Where there were multiple people with the same total target rem, actual pay was determined for all and then the median of that group was used.\n\nAs required by and in accordance with section 2-21 of the GRI2: General Disclosures 2021, the following disclosure summarises the relationship of the annual total compensation of the median employee worldwide and the annual total compensation of the companyÃ¢ÂÂs highest-paid individual, which for FY23 was the Interim CEO, Sherry Duhe and for FY22 was the CEO at the time, Sandeep Biswas.\nThe ratio of the annual total compensation for Newcrest's highest-paid individual to the median annual total compensation for all employees for FY23 is 12:1. This compares to the ratio in FY22 of 57:1. The change from FY22 to FY23 is primarily due to a change in the highest paid individual from year to year. Moreover, Sherry Duhe commenced FY23 as the CFO before being appointed Interim CEO on 19 December 2022. The remuneration set as Interim CEO was significantly lower than her predecessor. Additionally, Sandeep BiswasÃ¢ÂÂs remuneration in FY22 included vesting of previously granted Long Term Incentive awards, whereas Sherry Duhe did not have any Long Term Incentive awards vesting in FY23, due to her joining Newcrest comparatively recently.\nFurther detail on the highest paid individual can be obtained within the Remuneration Reports that form part of NewcrestÃ¢ÂÂs 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports. \n\nDue to the total compensation of the highest paid individual decreasing by 75% from FY22 to FY23, the Ã¢ÂÂratio of percentage increaseÃ¢ÂÂ required under Disclosure 2-21 b. cannot be meaningfully calculated.\n\nThe ratios were determined using actual total remuneration received during the 12 month period up to 30 June each year, including any annual incentive payments, vested equity, and location and roster allowances. The calculation excludes independent contractors and casual employees. Only active employees as at 30 June each year were considered in this analysis. Full-time equivalent pay rates are used for part-time employees. To arrive at a meaningful outcome, certain assumptions were made in determining the actual total remuneration received.",,,,,,,,,,,
