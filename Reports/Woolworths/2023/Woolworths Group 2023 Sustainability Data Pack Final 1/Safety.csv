,Ü General note,"All safety data excludes workers not in Woolworths Group payroll systems (PFD Foods, PetCulture and MyDeal).",,,,,,,,,
,Ü Footnote 1,"Severity rate was introduced as a business metric in F22. It is a more holistic measure than TRIFR, covering all injuries (physical and psychological) for team and customers, and including incidents with a high potential for serious injury or death. The F23 figure does not reflect the fatality reported in the Fatalities table due to the fact that it occurred after the official end of the financial year (27/06/2023).",,,,,,,,,
,Ü Footnote 2,"Tragically, two of our team members lost their lives during the year. We are deeply affected by this loss, and our thoughts remain with the families and many friends, and colleagues affected. A number of investigations into these events are ongoing and, while the outcomes may not be known for some time, we are working now to ensure learnings are gained and applied.",,,,,,,,,
,Ü Footnote 3,"HCI reporting data is not available for New Zealand. For F21, WooliesX was reported under Australian Food.",,,,,,,,,
,Ü Footnote 4,"Ill health figures have been re-stated due to changes in data source (claims vs incident system), criteria and retrospective movements.",,,,,,,,,
,Ü Footnote 5,Employee numbers covered by health & safety management systems include contractors.,,,,,,,,,
