4,,Term,Description,,,,,
5,,Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e),"A standard measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based onÃ¢ÂÂ¯their global warming potential. For example, one tonne ofÃ¢ÂÂ¯methane emissions is equivalent to 28 tonnes ofÃ¢ÂÂ¯carbon dioxide emissions overÃ¢ÂÂ¯aÃ¢ÂÂ¯100Ã¢ÂÂ¯yearÃ¢ÂÂ¯period.",,,,,
6,,Green electricity,"To align with RE100 and CDP reporting requirements our renewable electricity is only counted asÃ¢ÂÂ¯green electricity when renewable energy certificates are surrendered, or when the default renewable electricity supply from the grid exceeds 95%.",,,,,
7,,Health Star Rating,"The Health Star Rating is a voluntary front-of-pack labelling system in Australia and New Zealand that rates the overall nutritional profile of food and beverages from 0.5 star to 5 stars. It provides a quick and easy way for consumers to compare similar foods and make informed choices. TheÃ¢ÂÂ¯more stars, the healthier the choice.",,,,,
8,,Lost Time Injury (LTI)\nand Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR),"A Lost Time Injury (LTI) is an injury or illness that results in an employee being unable to work aÃ¢ÂÂ¯full scheduled shift (other than the shift during which the injury occurred). LTIFR refers to Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate, the number of lost time injuries occurring in aÃ¢ÂÂ¯workplace per one million hoursÃ¢ÂÂ¯worked.",,,,,
9,,GWh,Gigawatt hours is aÃ¢ÂÂ¯unit of measurement for electricity use.,,,,,
10,,National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER),"NGER established aÃ¢ÂÂ¯national framework for Australian corporations to report greenhouse gas emissions, reductions, removals and offsets, and energy consumption and production. ReferÃ¢ÂÂ¯toÃ¢ÂÂ¯this link.",,,,,
11,,Scope 1 emissions,"Direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company, such as combustion facilities (e.g. generators), calculated emissions from refrigerant gas leakages and combustion of fuels inÃ¢ÂÂ¯company-owned or company-controlled transport (e.g. cars and trucks).",,,,,
12,,Scope 2 emissions,"Indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, heat, cooling orÃ¢ÂÂ¯steam. Purchased electricity is defined as electricity that is bought or otherwise brought into theÃ¢ÂÂ¯organisational boundary of the entity.",,,,,
13,,Scope 2 location-based emissions methodology,A location-based method reflect the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs (using mostly grid-average emission factor data),,,,,
14,,Scope 2 market-based emissions methodology,"A market-based method reflects emissions from electricity that companies have purposefully chosen (or the lack of choice). It derives emission factors from contractual instruments, which include any type of contract between two parties for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims",,,,,
15,,Scope 3 emissions,"Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions that are aÃ¢ÂÂ¯consequence of aÃ¢ÂÂ¯companyÃ¢ÂÂs activities, butÃ¢ÂÂ¯that arise from sources that other entities own or control. Scope 3, like scope 2, is aÃ¢ÂÂ¯category of indirect emissions and covers all other indirect emissions from sources that are not owned or controlled byÃ¢ÂÂ¯aÃ¢ÂÂ¯company, but that occur asÃ¢ÂÂ¯aÃ¢ÂÂ¯result of its activities. Examples include emissions generated inÃ¢ÂÂ¯theÃ¢ÂÂ¯production of the products we sell and from waste disposal toÃ¢ÂÂ¯landfill.",,,,,
16,,Severity Rate,"Includes all team and customer injuries or illnesses (first aid through to lost time injuries, bothÃÂ physical and psychological) and events with potential for high severity.",,,,,
17,,Supply Chain,Activities carried out by entities upstream from Woolworths Group which provide products and services that are used in the development of the Groups products or services.,,,,,
18,,Sustainable Development Goals (SDG),17 global goals set by the United Nations in 2015 to define global sustainable development priorities and aspirations for the planet.,,,,,
19,,Sustainable Sourcing,Includes a combination of physically certified (or independently verified) commodities; and the purchase of offsets to support the sustainable production of a commodity if physical certification cannot be achieved. Our sourcing policies should be referred to for commodity-specific details.,,,,,
20,,Total Recordable Injury (TRI) and Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR),"A Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) is the sum of the total number ofÃ¢ÂÂ¯employee fatalities, lost time injuries, restricted work injuries or medical treatment injuries per million hoursÃ¢ÂÂ¯worked.",,,,,
21,,Value Chain,Activities carried out by Woolworths Group and by entities upstream eg suppliers and downstream eg customers to bring products or services from their conception to their end use. The value chain includes the supply chain.,,,,,
