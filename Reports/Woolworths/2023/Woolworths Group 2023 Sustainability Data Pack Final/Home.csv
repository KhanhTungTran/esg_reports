,About this data pack,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This data pack provides a view of Woolworths performance on a wide range of Sustainability-related areas for the 2023 financial year. Where available, historical data are included for financial years 2021 and 2022. In some instances, historical data have been adjusted to reflect organisational changes, such as the demerger of the Endeavour Group (originally included in our published F21 report), or to accommodate improvements in methodology. Explanatory notes at the bottom of each tab provide further context.

Data cover our operations in Australia and New Zealand for the 2023 financial period: 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023 (F23) or 27 June 2022 to 25 June 2023 if based on weekly sales data. Deloitte has provided independent assurance of select information included in this data pack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The forward looking statements in this Sustainability Data Pack are based on management’s good faith, current expectations and reflect judgements, assumptions and estimates and other information available as at the date of release of this Sustainability Data Pack.
