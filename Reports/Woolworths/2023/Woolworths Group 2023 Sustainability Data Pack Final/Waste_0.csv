39,,ÃÂ Additional methodological notes,"For our Australian Food and New Zealand Food divisions, for which detailed site-specific waste diversion data was used, some adjustments were made to correct for suspected data entry errors. In all cases, these adjustments decreased the amount of food diverted from landfill, providing a conservative approach.\nDetailed food diversion data for the New Zealand Food division, available for the second half of F23, was used to extrapolate H1.\nEstimates of the proportion of food waste going to landfill were used for our Primary Connect division and Corporate Offices.",,,,,,,
