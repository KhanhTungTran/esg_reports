59,,ÃÂ General note,"In November 2022, the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) provided new guidance on the treatment of Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCU) issued for projects registered with the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF).ÃÂ Since 2016, Woolworths has had registered projects with the ERF, delivering emissions reductions through energy efficiency and waste reduction. These projects generated 130,046 ACCUs in F21, 137,750 ACCUs in F22 and 170,288 ACCUs in F23 (this being their final year). As per the new CER guidance, the ACCUs issued in F22 and F23 have been added to the respective emissions numbers. F21 emissions have not been adjusted in the same way (the values at stake did not meet the materiality threshold and the Regulator's updated guidance referred to the year 2022).\nF22 emissions associated with stationary refrigerants, transportation refrigerants and home delivery fuel usage have been revised to reflect improved data tracking.\n",,,,,,,,

61,,ÃÂ Footnote 2,2015 baseline has been adjusted to reflect the de-merger of Endeavour Group.,,,,,,,,
