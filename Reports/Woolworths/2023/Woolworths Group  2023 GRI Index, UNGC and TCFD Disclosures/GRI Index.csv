,"403-2 Hazard identification, risk assessment, and incident investigation","The Woolworths Group Safety & Health Standards set the requirements for hazard identification and risk assessment for routine and non-routine activities; along with Incident management (including investigation). 
 
Risk management processes including hazard identification, risk assessments, workplace inspections and incident reporting which seek input and involvement from team members and contractors. Team members are also trained to identify, assess, control (where possible) and report hazards they observe. Hazards are assessed using the Woolworths Group enterprise risk matrix for health and safety to determine the risk (rating) they pose based on the potential consequence (severity of harm) and the likelihood that harm will occur. Risks are escalated to different levels of the organisation based on their rating.
 
As part of our annual strategy and planning cycle, Woolworths Group Safety, Health and Wellbeing completes a risk review of our operations to identify hazards, assess risks and identify where existing controls can be strengthened or new controls can be implemented by applying the hierarchy of controls. Hazard and incident data, risk assessments, safety investigations, changes in our operations, legislation, codes of practice, standards and industry knowledge are considered as part of the review. Outputs of the review are included within Woolworths Group Annual Strategic Plan (Strategy) along with Business Unit specific plans focused on risk management.

Woolworths encourages team members, contractors and customers to report hazards and to stop work when they feel their safety is at risk. The Woolworths Code of Conduct includes our commitments to safety for our team and highlights that they must always, and have our full support to: always address hazards as they become aware of them, and immediately stop any job or task that they believe is unsafe.  Team members have many ways in which they can report work-related hazards and hazardous situations. They include: 
 - directly to their line manager 
 - engagement of their Health and Safety Representative / Safety team member 
 - using the ‘Pulse’ hazard reporting program 
 - through programmed hazard inspection activities 
 - using the health and safety issue resolution process 
 - anonymously through the Speak Up program 

Business units have issue resolution process, safety and health representation/safety team member and arrangements to assist where needed. This protects team members from reprisals. Regulators and team member representatives can be invited into the issue resolution process at any stage. 
 
 The Group Speak Up process enables anonymous reporting preventing any possibility of reprisal against team members. 

The Safety, Health and Wellbeing (SH&W) Management System includes a procedure to investigate SH&W incidents, with the level of investigation being guided based on the severity of the incident. Investigations on more significant incidents (Category 1 and 2 incidents) are required to identify the root cause and any contributing factors of work-related incidents (incorporating appropriate investigation methodologies) and implement and track the completion of corrective actions. 
 
 Risk control measures in accordance with the hierarchy of controls and legal requirements are reviewed during the investigation process. Investigations: 
 - are undertaken by competent team members in accordance with our procedure 
 - identify the factor(s) that led to the injury, illness, incident or other system failure 
 - review the identified hazards, assessed risks and effectiveness of the control measures 
 - recommend appropriate control measures and corrective actions 
 
Corrective actions are determined in consultation with affected team members (including affected contractors and other persons), implemented in a timely manner, and assessed for their effectiveness. Incident, injury and illness data including investigation findings, hazards and risk assessments are captured in a safety incident management system. This data is reviewed regularly to identify any emerging trends and implement required improvement actions in the Safety and Health Management System.  Incidents with high potential are reviewed at a Group level to ensure learnings and any group wide actions (where needed) are undertaken.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,403-3 Occupational health services,"We provide various occupational health service functions to support the health, safety and wellbeing of our team members and contractors. We utilise the services of ergonomists, physiologists and physiotherapists, psychologists, and occupational health nurses, and other allied health specialists as required, to assist with identification and management of health and safety risks that may impact the health and wellbeing of our team members and contractors. The way these services are utilised varies by business, based on type of activities and risk exposures. Woolworths ensures the quality of the services by using independent occupational health service providers with recognised qualifications and accreditations. 

Where applicable, team members are provided with time off their normal work tasks to consult with occupational health services such as for health assessment and treatment. We offer open access for our team members and contractors to confidential counselling and support services through our employee assistance program via Sonder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"403-4 Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and safety","Team members, safety committees and team members representatives (Unions) are consulted on and participate in safety, health & wellbeing (SH&W)  matters including the development, and evaluation of the Safety, Health & Wellbeing Management Systems. The requirements for communication and consultation in relation to SH&W  matters are set out in the Group Safety & Health Standards. 
 
Communication and consultation occurs through a number of forums, for example SH&W committees, team talks, internal communications, union communications, workplace inspections, audits, safety alerts, surveys and feedback forms. 
 
Each business has consultative arrangements. There are procedures agreed to by team members and management outlining their involvement and consultation in health and safety matters and issues. 
 
 Some businesses have Health and Safety Representative (HSR) arrangements, and some have other consultative arrangements such as safety committees and store safety leads. 
 
The HSR or safety committees/store safety leads and/or other team members participate in assessment and control of risks, health and safety training, workplace inspections and hazard identification, committee meetings, accident/incident investigations, development, implementation and review of procedures. 
 
The consultation arrangements, including meeting frequency differs in each business. They range from monthly, bi-monthly to quarterly. 
 
 All team members, including HSR’s and safety committee members have the authority to stop work if they think a task or process is unsafe. HSR’s have the additional authority to issue provisional improvement notices to the business.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,403-5 Worker training on occupational health and safety,"Each business completes an analysis of the safety and health training or skills that each role requires to safely fulfil the responsibilities assigned to them and then builds a documented training plan which outlines areas such as legislative, formal, on the job and refresher training requirements. The plan is implemented so that team members are trained (as appropriate) to perform their work safely. 
 
 Training is delivered using a variety of methods including classroom and on-the-job learning, simulators and online learning depending on the needs of the participant and the type of content being delivered. Training may cover areas such as hazard awareness, risk management, incident investigation, task and job related skills and safe operating procedures for equipment. Team members are provided time during their paid work day to complete required training. Required training is provided to team members free of charge. 
 
 Training may be delivered by registered training organisations or in-house depending on the content, and is designed and delivered at a level suitable for team members. Competency assessment requirements are defined based on the risks involved and any relevant legislative or industry requirements. Training effectiveness is reviewed on a regular basis and considers any relevant incident history or new information about a risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,403-6 Promotion of worker health,"Woolworths offers a range of services to team members to access to occupational medical and healthcare services such as physiotherapy services, access to onsite gym and wellness centres and psychological support and counselling services through the Sonder program, discounted health and insurance memberships.

,403-7 Prevention and mitigation of occupational health and safety impacts directly linked by business relationships,"Woolworths has in place policies, standards and processes to address occupational safety, health & wellbeing risks posed by our business relationships including with suppliers and contract partners both locally and globally. 
 
 Our Responsible Sourcing Policy details our commitment and expectations for suppliers whom we have a direct relationship with for goods and/or services we sell or use in our businesses. We require our suppliers to abide by our Responsible Sourcing Standards which includes comprehensive criteria on business integrity, labour rights, fair and safe working conditions and environmental compliance. The standards specifically call out requirements to prevent and mitigate significant negative occupational health and safety impacts, including but not limited to complying with relevant local laws and regulations. Where there is a gap between our requirements and standards and the local laws, rules and regulations, the more stringent requirements and standards apply. 
 
 Our Woolworths Contractor Safety RIsk Management program manages contractors who undertake activities.  Our Contractor Safety Risk Management  program adopts a risk-based approach to categorise and manage contractors based on the work they perform on our sites.  We pre-qualify contractors, based on risk, which may rquire self- assessment, requesting policies, procedures or records , desktop review or a formal audit.
