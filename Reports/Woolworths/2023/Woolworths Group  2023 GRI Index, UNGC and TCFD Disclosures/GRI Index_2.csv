127,,"403-2 Hazard identification, risk assessment, and incident investigation","The Woolworths Group Safety & Health Standards set the requirements for hazard identification and risk assessment for routine and non-routine activities; along with Incident management (including investigation). \n \nRisk management processes including hazard identification, risk assessments, workplace inspections and incident reporting which seek input and involvement from team members and contractors. Team members are also trained to identify, assess, control (where possible) and report hazards they observe. Hazards are assessed using the Woolworths Group enterprise risk matrix for health and safety to determine the risk (rating) they pose based on the potential consequence (severity of harm) and the likelihood that harm will occur. Risks are escalated to different levels of the organisation based on their rating.\n \nAs part of our annual strategy and planning cycle, Woolworths Group Safety, Health and Wellbeing completes a risk review of our operations to identify hazards, assess risks and identify where existing controls can be strengthened or new controls can be implemented by applying the hierarchy of controls. Hazard and incident data, risk assessments, safety investigations, changes in our operations, legislation, codes of practice, standards and industry knowledge are considered as part of the review. Outputs of the review are included within Woolworths Group Annual Strategic Plan (Strategy) along with Business Unit specific plans focused on risk management.\n\nWoolworths encourages team members, contractors and customers to report hazards and to stop work when they feel their safety is at risk. The Woolworths Code of Conduct includes our commitments to safety for our team and highlights that they must always, and have our full support to: always address hazards as they become aware of them, and immediately stop any job or task that they believe is unsafe. Team members have many ways in which they can report work-related hazards and hazardous situations. They include: \n - directly to their line manager \n - engagement of their Health and Safety Representative / Safety team member \n - using the Ã¢ÂÂPulseÃ¢ÂÂ hazard reporting program \n - through programmed hazard inspection activities \n - using the health and safety issue resolution process \n - anonymously through the Speak Up program \n\nBusiness units have issue resolution process, safety and health representation/safety team member and arrangements to assist where needed. This protects team members from reprisals. Regulators and team member representatives can be invited into the issue resolution process at any stage. \n \n The Group Speak Up process enables anonymous reporting preventing any possibility of reprisal against team members. \n\nThe Safety, Health and Wellbeing (SH&W) Management System includes a procedure to investigate SH&W incidents, with the level of investigation being guided based on the severity of the incident. Investigations on more significant incidents (Category 1 and 2 incidents) are required to identify the root cause and any contributing factors of work-related incidents (incorporating appropriate investigation methodologies) and implement and track the completion of corrective actions. \n \n Risk control measures in accordance with the hierarchy of controls and legal requirements are reviewed during the investigation process. Investigations: \n - are undertaken by competent team members in accordance with our procedure \n - identify the factor(s) that led to the injury, illness, incident or other system failure \n - review the identified hazards, assessed risks and effectiveness of the control measures \n - recommend appropriate control measures and corrective actions \n \nCorrective actions are determined in consultation with affected team members (including affected contractors and other persons), implemented in a timely manner, and assessed for their effectiveness. Incident, injury and illness data including investigation findings, hazards and risk assessments are captured in a safety incident management system. This data is reviewed regularly to identify any emerging trends and implement required improvement actions in the Safety and Health Management System. Incidents with high potential are reviewed at a Group level to ensure learnings and any group wide actions (where needed) are undertaken.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
