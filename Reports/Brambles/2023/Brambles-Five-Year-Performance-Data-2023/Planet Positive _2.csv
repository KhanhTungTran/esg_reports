'Market-Based' Scope 2 emissions include the purchase of electricity through renewable energy contracts, Renewable Energy Certificates and onsite power generation. 'Location-based' emissions reported cover all electricity that is purchased through a 3rd party supplier and not under a renewable electricity contract/certificate",,,,,,,,,,,,,
