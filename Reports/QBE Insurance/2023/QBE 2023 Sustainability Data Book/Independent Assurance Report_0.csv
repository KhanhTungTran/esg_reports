66,,,"Our assurance conclusion is with respect to the reporting period described in Table 1 and does not extend to information in respect of earlier periods or to any other information included in, or linked from, the Sustainability Data Book.",,,
68,,,Responsibilities of Management,,,
69,,,Management of QBE are responsible for the preparation of the Subject Matter in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes:,,,
70,,,"Ã¢ÂÂ¢ determining appropriate reporting topics and selecting or establishing suitable criteria for measuring, evaluating and preparing the underlying Subject Matter;",,,
71,,,Ã¢ÂÂ¢ ensuring that those criteria are relevant and appropriate to the Group and the intended users; and,,,
72,,,"Ã¢ÂÂ¢ designing, implementing and maintaining systems, processes and internal controls over information relevant to the evaluation or measurement of the Subject Matter, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, against the Criteria.",,,
74,,,Our independence and quality control,,,
75,,,"We have complied with the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standard Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) relevant to assurance engagements, which are founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.",,,
77,,,"Our firm applies Australian Standard on Quality Management ASQM 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.",,,
79,,,Our responsibilities,,,
80,,,Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained.,,,
82,,,"Our engagement has been conducted in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements (ASAE 3000) Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ASAE 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements. Those standards require that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether anything has come to our attention to indicate that the Subject Matter has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria, with respect to the reporting period described in Table 1.",,,
84,,,"The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement and consequently the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion.",,,
86,,,The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included:,,,
87,,,"Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Undertaking enquiries with the GroupÃ¢ÂÂs management regarding the process and controls for capturing, collating and reporting the Subject Matter;",,,
88,,,Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Reconciling the Subject Matter with the GroupÃ¢ÂÂs underlying records;,,,
89,,,Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Agreeing the underlying records back to supporting third-party documentation on a sample basis;,,,
90,,,Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Undertaking analytical review procedures over data and obtaining explanations from management regarding unusual or unexpected amounts;,,,
91,,,"Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Assessing the reasonableness of measurement methods, estimates, and assumptions made in preparing the Subject Matter; and",,,
92,,,Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Considering the presentation and disclosure of the Subject Matter.,,,
94,,,We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.,,,
96,,,Inherent limitations,,,
97,,,"Inherent limitations exist in all assurance engagements due to the selective testing of the information being examined. It is therefore possible that fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and not be detected. A limited assurance engagement is not designed to detect all instances of non-compliance of the Subject Matter with the Criteria, as it is limited primarily to making enquiries of the GroupÃ¢ÂÂs management and applying analytical procedures.",,,
99,,,"Additionally, non-financial data may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given both its nature and the methods used for determining, calculating and estimating such data. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, evaluation and measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over time.",,,
101,,,The limited assurance conclusion expressed in this report has been formed on the above basis.,,,
103,,,Our limited assurance conclusion,,,
104,,,"Based on the procedures we have performed, as described under Ã¢ÂÂOur responsibilitiesÃ¢ÂÂ and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria for the reporting period described in Table 1.",,,
106,,,Emphasis of matter,,,
107,,,"The estimation of Ã¢ÂÂTotal of selected Scope 3 emissionsÃ¢ÂÂ reported by QBE relies on assumptions and available sources of primary, secondary and proxy data across different sources of scope 3 emissions. We draw attention to the Criteria that describes these assumptions and data sources for different Scope 3 emissions sources along with the exclusion of Category 1: Supplier Emissions and Category 15: Investments from calculation of Ã¢ÂÂTotal of selected Scope 3 emissionsÃ¢ÂÂ metric.",,,
109,,,Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.,,,
111,,,Use and distribution of our report,,,
112,,,"We were engaged by the board of Directors of QBE to prepare this independent assurance report having regard to the criteria specified by the Group and set out in this report. This report was prepared solely for QBE in accordance with the agreement between us, to assist the directors in responding to their governance responsibilities by obtaining an independent assurance report in connection with the Subject Matter.",,,
