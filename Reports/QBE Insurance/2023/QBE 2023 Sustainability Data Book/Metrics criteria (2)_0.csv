20,,,,9,Corporate community investment (breakdown),,"As defined by the B4SI methodology:\n\nCommunity investments are inclined to be more proactive and strategic than charitable gifts. They can centre on a smaller number of larger-scale, longer-term projects and often run as a partnership with, rather than a donation to, a community organisation.\n\nCommercial initiatives in the community are business-related activities, usually undertaken by departments outside the community function (e.g. marketing, R&D), to support the success of the company and promote its brand and other policies, that also deliver community benefit. The most common example of this is cause-related marketing. These are primarily marketing campaigns but involve a contribution from the company to a charitable cause. It is developing or adapting core commercial activities that create clearly defined social impact, and generate a clear return to the business. The focus of this activity is to benefit both society and the business.\n\nCharitable donations are often reactive in that they respond to appeals for help, either directly from charities, or through requests from employees (including matched funding or payroll giving), or in response to short-term or one-off events.",3,,,,,,,,
