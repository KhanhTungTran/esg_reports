Heating cost is embedded in the lease payment. \n\nHeating emissions where QBE has direct gas billing is reported under Scope 1 Ã¢ÂÂ Stationary energy gas. \n\nWe identified that only offices in UK, Europe and North America utilise office heating due to their cold climate during winter. Other regions such as Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Pacific and UAE have no heating utilised due to their warmer climate.\n\nEstimate natural gas usage: \nUK and Europe: \nThe Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers (CIBSE) provides the latest energy benchmarking metrics of 97kWh natural gas/m2/year applied for offices (https://www.cibse.org/knowledge-research/knowledge-resources/knowledge-toolbox/energy-benchmarking-tool). This benchmark is based on UK averages and is representative for QBE UK and Europe offices based on average measured kWh/m2/year reported by the UK offices with natural gas direct billing (Chelmsford and Stafford offices in 2021) (98.5 kWh/m2/year). The benchmark is used without correction of data centres or occupancy. \n\nThe 97kWh natural gas/m2/year benchmark is applied to floor area (net lettable area) in calculations and excludes UK offices already reporting under Scope 1 Ã¢ÂÂ direct emissions.",1,,,,,,,,
