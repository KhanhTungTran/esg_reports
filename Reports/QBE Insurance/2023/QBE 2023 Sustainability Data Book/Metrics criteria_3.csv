The most common example of this is cause-related marketing. These are primarily marketing campaigns but involve a contribution from the company to a charitable cause. It is developing or adapting core commercial activities that create clearly defined social impact, and generate a clear return to the business. The focus of this activity is to benefit both society and the business.\n\nCharitable donations are often reactive in that they respond to appeals for help, either directly from charities, or through requests from employees (including matched funding or payroll giving), or in response to short-term or one-off events.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
