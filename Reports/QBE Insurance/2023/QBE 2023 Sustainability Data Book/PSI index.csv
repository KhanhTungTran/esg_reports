,,"About this Index: The Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) are a framework for the global insurance industry to address environmental, social and governance risks and opportunities. QBE has been a signatory to the PSI since 2015 and the Principles inform the approach we take to embedding sustainability considerations into our business decision-making. As signatories to the PSI, we are required to make an annual disclosure outlining our progress in implementing the Principles (this document).  This year we are reporting via an index to the relevant disclosures that correspond to the principles, primarily within our 2023 Sustainability Report or website. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
