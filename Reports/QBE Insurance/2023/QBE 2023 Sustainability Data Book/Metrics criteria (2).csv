,,,9,Corporate community investment (breakdown),,"As defined by the B4SI methodology:

Community investments are inclined to be more proactive and strategic than charitable gifts. They can centre on a smaller number of larger-scale, longer-term projects and often run as a partnership with, rather than a donation to, a community organisation.

Commercial initiatives in the community are business-related activities, usually undertaken by departments outside the community function (e.g. marketing, R&D), to support the success of the company and promote its brand and other policies, that also deliver community benefit. The most common example of this is cause-related marketing. These are primarily marketing campaigns but involve a contribution from the company to a charitable cause. It is developing or adapting core commercial activities that create clearly defined social impact, and generate a clear return to the business. The focus of this activity is to benefit both society and the business.

Charitable donations are often reactive in that they respond to appeals for help, either directly from charities, or through requests from employees (including matched funding or payroll giving), or in response to short-term or one-off events. ",3,,,,,,,,

For QBE, capital goods comprised computers, laptops, monitors and printers sourced from fixed assets registers at 31 December 2023. Emissions data is sourced from manufacturers’ product lifecycle emissions published data. 

Capital goods emissions are estimated by using the following formula:
Good purchased during the reporting year x equipment’s lifecycle emissions. 

For simplification purposes, QBE adopted a hybrid approach in measuring capital goods emissions:
(i) [A]: Emissions are calculated based on Australia’s fixed asset register at asset level and individual asset emissions level. The fixed asset register includes all Australian IT equipment at 31 December 2023.
(ii) [B]: Capital goods emissions per FTE = capital goods emissions from [A] above / Total FTE of Australia.
(iii) [C]: Country’s capital goods emissions = capital goods emissions per FTE from [B] above x number of FTE of that country.
FTE is used based on the assumption that there is a direct correlation between the number of FTE and the number of IT equipment use.

,,,Category 6 – Business travel,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,50,Business travel – air,,"Description: Emissions related to air business travel by travel class (economy, premium economy, business class or first class) and by travel type (short haul or long haul). Travel data includes business travel by employees and policyholders as part of their insurance claims related to the relevant insurance product purchased. Travel data is sourced from the travel management company that centrally manages each division's travel (mainly Australia, UK/Europe and North America). For small NZ, Asia and Pacific countries, travel data is obtained through the country’s own air travel records.

Emissions factors applied to passenger KM air travelled are sourced from UK DEFRA’s required distance uplift and exclude radiative forcing due to the significant scientific uncertainty surrounding the quantification of the effect of radiative forcing.

,,,51,Business travel – car hire and taxi,,"Description:  Emissions related to car hire and taxi business travel by employees and policyholders as part of their policy claims. Car hire KM travelled data is sourced from third party car hire company reports. Taxi data is sourced from cab charges/taxi claims booked in the general ledger, and the cost is divided by average taxi cost per KM travelled, to derive estimated KM travelled by taxi. The average taxi cost per KM is estimated by each country based on their knowledge of average taxi cost per KM relevant to their country. 

Emissions are measured by:
KM travelled from car hire and taxi x DEFRA emissions factor for an average car with unknown fuel source.

Scope: 
Group consolidated entities. Excluding associates/joint venture where QBE does not have operational control.

,,,Category 7 – Employee commuting,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,53,Employee commuting,,"Description: Emissions related to employee commuting to/from home and office are estimated based on average KM commute by employee per typical working day, per country, based on international surveys and publications. 
QBE estimation is based on the following assumptions:
Average daily KM commute:
• 40KM daily commute in UK, USA and Canada; 
• 30KM daily commute in Australia, NZ, China, Japan and UAE; and
• 20KM in Western Europe and small Asia and Pacific countries.
Mode of commute transport:
• USA and Canada – based on the country’s Bureau of Statistics (53% car, 32% public transport, 5% motorbike, and 10% bike or walk to work).
• UK and European countries – based on the national statistics (83% travelled by subway, 4% bus, 2% car and 10% bike or walk to work) 
• Australia - based on the country's published statistics (32% car, 17% bus, 13% train, 38% bike or walk to work). 
* Philippines - based on the country's published statistics (49% bus/jeepney, 8% motorbike, 8% car, 35% bike or walk to work).
• For small Pacific counties - assumed 95% travel by bus and 5% walk or bike to the office.
Emissions estimation is based on the following formula:
FTE per country x average number of days working in the office x average KM daily commute per working day per country x average percentage of transport mode x DEFRA emission factor for each travel type. 	

QBE adopts a hybrid-working model and on average employees are working from home 3 days per week and 2 days in the office.
