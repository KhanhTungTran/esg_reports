49,,,,28,Business travel Ã¢ÂÂ air,,"Description: Emissions related to air business travel by travel class (economy, premium economy, business class or first class) and by travel type (short haul or long haul). Travel data includes business travel by employees and policyholders as part of their insurance claims related to the relevant insurance product purchased. Travel data is sourced from the travel management company that centrally manages each division's travel (mainly Australia, UK/Europe and North America). For small NZ, Asia and Pacific countries, travel data is obtained through the countryÃ¢ÂÂs own air travel records.\n\nEmissions factors applied to passenger KM air travelled are sourced from UK DEFRAÃ¢ÂÂs required distance uplift and exclude radiative forcing due to the significant scientific uncertainty surrounding the quantification of the effect of radiative forcing.\n\nThe UK DEFRA emission factors are released annually to incorporate updated air travel assumptions. In 2023, due to reduced passenger numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, DEFRAÃ¢ÂÂs air travel emission factors for short-haul and long-haul flights have increased by 21% and 35% respectively. Anticipating a return to pre-COVID passenger numbers, it is not considered appropriate to apply the 2023 DEFRA factors, based on pandemic-period travel data, to calculate emissions for the organisations 2023 travel activity. \n\nThis report maintains consistency by using the 2022 UK DEFRA factors against the 2023 passenger kilometres for comparability with previous years. The impact of using the 2023 UK DEFRA factors would be an increase in the GHG emissions for business travel of 2,472 tCO2, keeping all other inputs constant.\n\nScope: Group consolidated entities. Excluding associates/joint venture where QBE does not have operational control.\n\nUnit:\nEmissions unit: tCO2e.\nUnderlying unit: KM air travel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,,,,29,Business travel Ã¢ÂÂ car hire and taxi,,"Description: Emissions related to car hire and taxi business travel by employees and policyholders as part of their policy claims. Car hire KM travelled data is sourced from third party car hire company reports. Taxi data is sourced from cab charges/taxi claims booked in the general ledger, and the cost is divided by average taxi cost per KM travelled, to derive estimated KM travelled by taxi. The average taxi cost per KM is estimated by each country based on their knowledge of average taxi cost per KM relevant to their country. \n\nEmissions are measured by:\nKM travelled from car hire and taxi x DEFRA emissions factor for an average car with unknown fuel source.\n\nScope: \nGroup consolidated entities. Excluding associates/joint venture where QBE does not have operational control.\nCar Hire and Taxis are used by major divisions: Australia, UK/Europe and North America.\nSmall countries such NZ, Asia and Pacific have little or no car hire and taxi activities.\n\nUnit:\nEmissions unit: tCO2e.\nUnderlying unit: KM travelled",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Excluding associates/joint venture where QBE does not have operational control.\nOnly UK/Europe used rail and bus as alternative to air travel due to the close proximity of European countries.

53,,,,31,Employee commuting,,"Description: Emissions related to employee commuting to/from home and office are estimated using average KM commute by employee per typical working day, mode of transport and country, based on internal employee surveys which had a 25% response rate. \nQBE estimation is based on the following employee survey data for the major countries of operation:\n\nAverage daily KM commute:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 22KM daily commute in Australia.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 16KM daily commute in United States of America.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 28KM in United Kingdom; and\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 17KM in the Philippines.\n\nMode of commute transport:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Australia - 22% car, 17% bus, 42% train, 19% bike, walk or other.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ United States of America 40% car, 10% public transport, and 50% bike, walk or other.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ United Kingdom 64% travelled by train, 3% bus, 20% car and 13% bike, walk or other.\n* Philippines - 54% bus/jeepney, 14% motorbike, 22% car, 10% bike, walk or other.\nQBE adopts a hybrid-working model and on a global basis employees are working from home on average 3 days per week and 2 days in the office. The averages used in the emissions calculation are on a country-by-country basis which can differ to the global average.\n\nEmissions estimation is based on the following formula:\nFTE per country x average number of days working in the office per country x average KM daily commute per working day per country x average percentage of transport mode x DEFRA emission factor for each travel type. \n\nScope: Group consolidated entities.
