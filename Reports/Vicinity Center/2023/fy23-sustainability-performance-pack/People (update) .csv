3 - Vicinity has extremely low injury rates with our workforce, which has made it difficult to identify further meaningful improvement opportunities. Given these low injury rates, Vicinity has determined that we will no longer report injury performance indicators in our annual sustainability reporting, but will resume reporting if there is a material increase, and will continue to monitor our performance internally to ensure the effectiveness of our safety practices is maintained.
