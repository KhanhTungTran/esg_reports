0,,12. United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,
1,,"The SDGs were developed by the United Nations in 2015 as a blueprint to achieve a more sustainable and equitable future for all by 2030. The SDGs consist of 17 goals and 169 related targets that seek to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure all people enjoy peace and prosperity. All UN Member States have adopted the SDGs\n\nWhilst Cleanaway recognises the importance and interdependence of all 17 goals, we have identified and prioritised eight core SDGs most relevant to our business that we can contribute to. We know that alignment does not equate to impact. The SDGs represent an ambitious agenda and we will work in the coming years to make the strategic and operational changes required to make a positive contribution.\n\nWe also know that partnerships are important in achieving our goals. Our FY22 Sustainability Report provides information on how we are working with other companies to improve AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs resource recovery and recycling capacity, advance AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs transition to a circular economy and contributing to the SDGs.",
3,,Our alignment to SDGs,
4,,SDG,How this aligns to our business
5,,,"Our employees come from diverse backgrounds, experience, skills and needs. This gives us a deep appreciation of the competitiveness, flexibility, and resilience that diversity brings. Whether itÃ¢ÂÂs a different background or a different way of thinking, our business is stronger with those perspectives being heard.\n\nAn important part of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace is increasing female participation across our workforce. Effective from FY22, we have introduced new female participation targets aligned to 40:40 Vision."
6,,,"At present, resource recovery is not an option for all waste streams, and a large proportion go to landfill, where they generate greenhouse gases.\n\nBy capturing gas from our landfills, we generate enough renewable electricity to power ~47,200 average homes and help reduce AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs reliance on fossil fuels. The majority of our heavy vehicles run on diesel. We are trialling electric vehicles in our fleet to reduce these emissions, and are a foundation partner of the Viva Energy New Energies Service Station Project which will see us procure and trial hydrogen fuel cell heavy vehicles.*\n\nEnergy from waste represents an important alternative to engineered landfill for managing waste that cannot be sustainably recovered. In addition to the safe and clean management of residual waste, it also enables the generation of low carbon clean energy."
7,,,"We provide direct employment for more than 7,500 people across 330+ sites all around Australia. We develop our peopleÃ¢ÂÂs skills and strive to provide a safe working environment. Collecting and processing waste poses safety hazards that we need to manage to keep our people safe. We are also mindful of our responsibilities in relation to labour rights and modern slavery, both in our own operations and our supply chain."
8,,,"Our network of prized assets provide critical infrastructure to support a circular economy and create a sustainable future, with the capacity to service the needs of the market. We continuously explore leading technology and processes to enable the circular economy and deliver innovative customer solutions."
9,,,"By helping cities to manage their waste effectively, our services help to reduce the environmental impact of cities and enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanisation."
10,,,"Cleanaway has a critical role to play in the sustainable management and use of natural resources, the responsible management of chemicals and waste, and supporting the reduction in waste generation. We believe that waste is a resource, and we focus on extracting the maximum value from every tonne. While we work towards more integrated services, we also actively partner with other organisations to drive our vision forward."
11,,,"We are working to reduce our GHG footprint. We recognise that landfill presents a particular challenge, as waste will continue to produce GHG emissions though natural decomposition long after it is disposed of. We are actively investing in ways to minimise this impact. Our resource recovery activities also help to reduce GHG emissions."
12,,,We adhere to all environmental legislation and licensing requirements to minimise adverse effects on the environments in which we operate. We endeavour to secure and conduct regular checks of all our facilities to prevent contaminants escaping and causing harm to the environment.
