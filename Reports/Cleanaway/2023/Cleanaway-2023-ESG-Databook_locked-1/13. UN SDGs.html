      <td>The SDGs were developed by the United Nations in 2015 as a blueprint to achieve a more sustainable and equitable future for all by 2030. The SDGs consist of 17 goals and 169 related targets that seek to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure all people enjoy peace and prosperity. All UN Member States have adopted the SDGs\n\nWhilst Cleanaway recognises the importance and interdependence of all 17 goals, we have identified and prioritised eight core SDGs most relevant to our business that we can contribute to. We know that alignment does not equate to impact. The SDGs represent an ambitious agenda and we will work in the coming years to make the strategic and operational changes required to make a positive contribution.\n\nWe also know that partnerships are important in achieving our goals. Our FY22 Sustainability Report provides information on how we are working with other companies to improve Australiaâs resource recovery and recycling capacity, advance Australiaâs transition to a circular economy and contributing to the SDGs.</td>

Whether itâs a different background or a different way of thinking, our business is stronger with those perspectives being heard.\n\nAn important part of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace is increasing female participation across our workforce. Effective from FY22, we have introduced new female participation targets aligned to 40:40 Vision.</td>

      <td>At present, resource recovery is not an option for all waste streams, and a large proportion go to landfill, where they generate greenhouse gases.\n\nBy capturing gas from our landfills, we generate enough renewable electricity to power ~47,200 average homes and help reduce Australiaâs reliance on fossil fuels. The majority of our heavy vehicles run on diesel. We are trialling electric vehicles in our fleet to reduce these emissions, and are a foundation partner of the Viva Energy New Energies Service Station Project which will see us procure and trial hydrogen fuel cell heavy vehicles.*\n\nEnergy from waste represents an important alternative to engineered landfill for managing waste that cannot be sustainably recovered. In addition to the safe and clean management of residual waste, it also enables the generation of low carbon clean energy.</td>
