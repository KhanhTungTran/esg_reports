      <td>This report focuses on the sustainability risks, opportunities and impacts that hold significant relevance for both our organisation and our stakeholders. \nGiven the importance of reflecting current and emerging trends, we undertook a materiality assessment in 2023. This process included: \n\n-\tEngaging with internal and external stakeholders.\n-\tFacilitating workshops and virtual surveys with a diverse range of internal stakeholders. representing Cleanawayâs business units.\n-\tUtilisation of survey feedback to aggregate, assign weights and evaluate scores.\n-\tStreamlining and reordering of topics based on internal input. \n-\tAdjusting our material topic definitions to convey clear and concise messaging. \n\nThroughout the assessment process, we considered evolving global Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) trends and the alignment with our \nBlueprint 2030 strategy. While reaffirming the significance of our material topics, the outcomes of the assessment also prompted certain adjustments \naimed at simplification and reprioritisation of material topics. \n\nIn particular:\n\nCulture, diversity and inclusion: amalgamation of Workplace culture and engagement and Diversity, equity and inclusion to better represent the \ninterdependence and management of these aspects.\n\nStrategic infrastructure: renamed from Strategic Assets to align to Blueprint 2030; importance increased.\n\nHealth, Safety and Environment: increased in importance as these topics are foundational to everything we do at Cleanaway.\n\nLow Carbon Energy Generation: removed as a separate topic and incorporated into Strategic infrastructure.\n\nWe remain committed to prioritising material topics based on their importance and impact level on Cleanaway and our stakeholders. \n\nThese topics are systematically linked to our ESG pillars: People, Planet and Prosperity. Subsequently, we developed a refreshed materiality matrix \nto visually illustrate the relative significance of these topics for Cleanaway and our stakeholders.</td>
