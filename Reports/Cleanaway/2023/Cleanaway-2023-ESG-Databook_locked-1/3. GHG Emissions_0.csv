72,,Risks to not meeting targets,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,,1. Disallowance or tightening of landfill gas capture ACCU methodology which may impact the speed to execution of one or more planned landfill gas capture initiatives.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,,"2. Removal of contracting mechanisms that currently allow sale of carbon credits generated from landfills to the government may require self-surrender of carbon credits with zero value, making certain capture projects economically unviable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,,3. Availability of carbon credit supply to meet our targets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,,4. Changes in market sentiment regarding the use of carbon credits as a meaningful method to reduce Cleanaway's emissions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
