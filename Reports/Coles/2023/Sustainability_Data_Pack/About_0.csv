For example, an organization can include Disclosure 3-3 in the GRI content index once, with a clear explanation of the topics it covers and where the information for each topic can be found. Alternatively, an organization can include Disclosure 3-3 under each topic it reports on together with the other disclosures from the GRI Standards that have been reported for the topic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
