"2. From 1 January 2023, the revised capital framework has come into effect. The revised capital framework refers to revisions to APRA's capital adequacy and credit risk capital requirements for ADIs. The primary impact of this change on NAB's resources exposures is a reduction in EAD due to changes in the calculation of off-balance sheet EAD for certain undrawn commitments. For more information on the impact of the revised capital framework and impacts on NAB's reported EAD, see NAB's 2023 Pillar 3 report, available at https://www.nab.com.au/about-us/shareholder-centre/regulatory-disclosures.",,,,,,,,,
"3. Oil and gas extraction EAD includes lending (e.g. revolving/term lending and guarantees) and other markets-related exposures (e.g. derivatives, foreign exchange, repurchase agreements).",,,,,,,,,
4. Thermal coal exposures includes direct exposure (including lending and guarantees) to customers whose primary activity is thermal coal mining. Includes performance guarantees for the rehabilitation of existing coal mining assets. Excludes metallurgical coal mining and diversified mining customers. ,,,,,,,,,

"2. NAB methodology (based upon the 1993 ANZSIC codes) at net EAD basis. Excludes exposure to counterparties predominantly involved in transmission and distribution. Vertically integrated retailers have been included and categorised as renewable where majority of their generation activities sourced from renewable energy. NAB has no direct lending to coal-fired power generation assets remaining, however there is indirect exposure to coal-fired power within the Mixed Fuel category as a result of NABâ€™s corporate level exposure to gentailers, which have a mix of generation assets (including coal, gas and renewables) within their generation portfolio.
