13,"1. The Employee Conduct Management framework was updated on the 1st October 2020. The framework is values and principles led. Focused on: Fairness Ã¢ÂÂ each matter is assessed on its own merit, Consistency Ã¢ÂÂ every colleague is held to account, and Proportionality Ã¢ÂÂ consequences match the severity of the misconduct. Previously our reporting focused only on significant cases that needed to escalated, therefore figures in 2019 and 2020 are not comparable with those reported from 2021. The increase in cases year on year may not necessarily reflect worse behaviour but more complete data as we continue to improve consistency and record all minor and mild matters independently managed by People Leaders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 2019, a 37.5-hour working week is used in the calculation for New Zealand. Past results may have been revised upwards due to additional lost time injuries being recorded after the reporting period has ended. Current year results may also be revised as additional lost time injuries are recorded in our system. Any updates will be reflected in future reporting.
