"1. All activities include emissions generated in Australia unless stated otherwise. Figures include emissions associated with Citi consumer business, Europe, Vietnam and India operations, where relevant from 2022.

2. BNZ’s 2022 emissions were restated to reflect minor changes. BNZ's Scope 2 emissions increased by 147 tCO2-e and Scope 3 emissions increased by 41 tCO2-e to account for a change in the electricity emissions factor due to MfE’s August 2022 release of ‘Measuring emissions: A guide for organisations: 2022 summary of emission factors’ and improved accuracy of water data in 2023 following release of 2022 accruals. The net change in total BNZ GHG emissions after accounting for renewable energy is 76 tCO2-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8. NAB excludes 'Employee commute' from its operational emissions boundary in 2023. NAB is currently compiling data and developing its methodology to estimate emissions associated with 'Employee commute' and will engage with stakeholders on this work in 2024. See p79-80 of NAB’s 2023 Climate Report for further information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9. In 2023, The Group has selected a market-based approach as its primary electricity accounting method in 2023, having previously used a location-based methodolgy. This change was made to better reflect the real impact of the increased proportion of LGCs in the Group’s electricity consumption.

NAB has changed its methodology for calculating market-based emissions to more closely align with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) in its Australian National Greenhouse Accounts Factors August 2023 manual. NAB has restated its 2022 market based emissions number from 77,236 to 60,829 tCO2-e. Market-based figures vary from Climate Active reporting as the Climate Active methodology for calculating market-based emissions incorporates the renewables applicable to the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) for the reporting period. The renewables applicable to the LRET is not included in NAB’s other publicly reported market-based emissions calculations due to applicable emissions accounting requirements. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"11. In 2023, The Group has selected a market-based approach as its primary electricity accounting method, having previously used a location-based methodolgy. This change was made to better reflect the real impact of the increased proportion of LGCs in the Group’s electricity consumption.

NAB has retired 64,566 carbon offsets in advance for the 2024 environmental reporting year in accordance with the Group’s Environmental Reporting and Offset Management Policy. The quantity of offsets retired is the same as our 2023 operational GHG emissions total (market-based emissions total). Per the Group’s year end reporting processes, actual 2024 offsets retired will be adjusted to match actual 2024 GHG emissions, which may vary based on changes in business operations during the 2024 environmental reporting year. In 2023, an additional 76 offsets have been retired because of historical emission restatements for the 2022 to account for emissions related to electricity and change in water consumption in our New Zealand operations. Additional offsets may need to be retired in 2023 for any additional historical changes. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1. In 2023, the Group updated its Scope 1 and 2 (market-based method) science-based GHG emissions reduction target to align its ambition to be net zero by 2050 with the best available science and pathway for a 1.5°C warming scenario. The Group's new target of 6,366 tCO2-e is for a 72% reduction in market-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 from a 2022 baseline of 23,018 tCO2-e, and includes all direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) and indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity (Scope 2) across all GHGs required under the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. The target has been prepared in accordance with the Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach (SDA) 'Services Buildings’ methodology published by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and SBTi target setting tool, v2.1.2. It aligns with a well-below 1.5°C scenario.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
