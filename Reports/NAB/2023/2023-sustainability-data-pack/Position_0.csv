14,5. Use of Underlying Profit as a metric (rather than measures of profit or economic activity) for normalisation of our environmental performance data allows for meaningful comparison to prior yearsÃ¢ÂÂ data and to financial intensity measures used in our CDP disclosures due to the nature of our underlying business activities. Please refer to GroupÃ¢ÂÂs 2023 Full Year Results Announcement (available at www.nab.com.au) for a more detailed explanation of the elements comprising the Underlying Profit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

30,"1. In 2023, the Group updated its Scope 1 and 2 (market-based method) science-based GHG emissions reduction target to align its ambition to be net zero by 2050 with the best available science and pathway for a 1.5ÃÂ°C warming scenario. The Group's new target is for a 72% reduction in market-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 from a 2022 baseline, and includes all direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) and indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity (Scope 2) across all GHGs required under the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. The target has been prepared in accordance with the Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach (SDA) 'Services BuildingsÃ¢ÂÂ methodology published by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and SBTi target setting tool, v2.1.2. It aligns with a well-below 1.5ÃÂ°C scenario.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"2. Except for Scope 1 and 2 (market-based method) science-based GHG emissions reduction target, other environmental performance targets have not been re-baselined. Baseline figures include data from MLC Wealth operations as NAB had operational control at the time of calculation. As the divestment from MLC Wealth did not have a material impact on the baseline figures, these have not been restated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,3. BNZÃ¢ÂÂs 2022 emissions were restated to reflect minor changes. BNZ's Scope 2 emissions increased by 147 tCO2-e and Scope 3 emissions increased by 41 tCO2-e to account for a change in the electricity emissions factor due to MfEÃ¢ÂÂs August 2022 release of Ã¢ÂÂMeasuring emissions: A guide for organisations: 2022 summary of emission factorsÃ¢ÂÂ and improved accuracy of water data in 2023 following release of 2022 accruals. The net change in total BNZ GHG emissions after accounting for renewable energy is 76 tCO2-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"4. NAB has changed its methodology for calculating market-based emissions to more closely align with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) in its Australian National Greenhouse Accounts Factors August 2023 manual. NAB has restated its 2022 market based emissions number from 77,236 to 60,829 tCO2-e. Market-based figures vary from Climate Active reporting as the Climate Active methodology for calculating market-based emissions incorporates the renewables applicable to the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) for the reporting period. The renewables applicable to the LRET is not included in NABÃ¢ÂÂs other publicly reported market-based emissions calculations due to applicable emissions accounting requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"Performance against targets\nA majority of the GroupÃ¢ÂÂs targets are on track to be met, except vehicle fuel and BNZ air travel. Management action is being taken to address this, where possible. Renewable energy purchases, efficiency initiatives, and branch closures have contributed towards the GroupÃ¢ÂÂs progress towards its 2025 Scope 1 and 2 (market-based method) science-based GHG emission reduction target.\n\nIn previous years, the GroupÃ¢ÂÂs 2020-25 environmental performance targets have included a BNZ only target for staff air travel Ã¢ÂÂ which was to reduce air travel emissions by 70% by 30 June 2025 from a 2019 baseline. In 2023, BNZ has achieved a 53% reduction, against its 70% air travel emissions reduction target, while reconnecting with customers post COVID-19, and in particular, helping customers respond to the devastation caused by extreme weather events in New Zealand. BNZ has decided to maintain its 2023 level of air travel to continue to support its customers, and to retire its 70% air travel emissions target. BNZ will continue to manage air travel but focus on other ways to reduce its overall operational emissions by 2025.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"Certifications \nThe Group's Environmental Management Policy is aligned to ISO 14001 requirements. Our approach to environmental management is integrated within our risk management framework, policies and procedures. In Australia, the detailed work procedures and activities covered by ISO 14001 are undertaken by an external property services provider on behalf of NAB.\n\nIn 2020, BNZ achieved ToitÃÂ« enviromark diamond certification, for its environmental management system, exceeding the requirements of ISO 14001, one of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs best known environmental standards. Diamond certification is aligned to ISO 14001. \nNAB published its Climate Active Public Disclosure Statement online here: https://www.nab.com.au/about-us/social-impact/shareholders/resource-library. \n\nIn New Zealand, BNZ and JBWere are ToitÃÂ« net carbon zero organisation certified to cover its operations in 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,Compliance\nThere were no fines or penalties for environmental non-compliance during the year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
