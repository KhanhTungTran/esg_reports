"1. As a result of our focus on major buildings and the purchase of renewable energy over the past few years, fewer other energy saving initiatives have been identified and implemented. A focus on lighting and HVAC upgrades across our Australian building portfolio including branches and business banking centres has continued and we plan to reassess outstanding energy efficiency initiatives and refresh our pipeline of energy efficiency opportunities in 2024.",,,,,,,,,,
"2. A project with no investment (AUD$) or payback value indicates that the environmental specific spend and payback cannot be separated from the cost of the underlying core project. Where specific spend and payback cannot be identified, it is not calculated.
