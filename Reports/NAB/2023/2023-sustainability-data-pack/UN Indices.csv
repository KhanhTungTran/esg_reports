United Nations Guiding Principles Business and Human Rights - Salient Issues,,,,,
"We understand that human rights issues can arise in our own operations and when engaging with external parties, especially customer interactions, financing and investments, and our supply chain. Salient human rights issues can occur in a range of geographies where the Group operates or has business relationships. The need to consider human rights - including the salient issues below- is incorporated within the Group's Human Rights Policy and ESG Risk Management processes (refer Annual Report p53-55).

We identify salient human rights issues through our internal risk management and materiality review processes. We also regularly engage with civil society and other stakeholders who raise human rights issues with us. During the year, we participated in a range of multi-stakeholder forums like industry, government and civil society seminars, roundtables and working groups to discuss human rights and grow shared understanding of issues such as modern slavery.

How we are addressing salient human rights is described throughout this report and is summarised in the table below.",,,,,
