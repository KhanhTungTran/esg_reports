      <td>Climate related risk was a key element of an internal company funded project, which ran from 2019 to 2021 as a focus on our ongoing commitment to decarbonisation. Climate  risk  was classified as a material risk area for Evolution in 2019 (note: climate change related risks were outlined in the 2019 Evolution Risk Register). Climate risk was also identified as a high material issue in the formal materiality assessment conducted in early 2021. We evaluate and monitor the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our businesses and corporate plans over a range of time horizons, and the Board, through the Risk &amp; Sustainability Committee, monitors progress every three months.\n\nThe Company consider short, medium, and long-term risks as noted below: \n - Short-term risks: risks which may materialise in the current annual reporting period \n - Medium-term risks: risks that may materialise over a 2-5-year timeframe\n - Long-term risks: risks which may fundamentally impact the viability of our long-term business strategy and our legacy extending 5-10-20 years \n\nThe climate-related physical risks identified as applicable to our business are as follows:\n - Energy and emissions: We keep informed of changing regulations, including policy, codes and principles to help manage transition risk. We engage with our community and stakeholders to ensure we are operating with a holistic mindset. We remain agile in response to changing markets and explore innovative technology including renewables to improve our resilience to resource financial and supply uncertainty. We aim to contribute positively to local, regional and national sustainability efforts\n - Water security: Production is reliant on the availability of water. In the short term, the Group is adapting to a changing water security environment by working towards reducing demand and reusing a greater portion of water. In the medium to long term, we are investing in water recycling and reuse strategies to improve efficiencies\n - Extreme weather events: We ensure we minimise the impact of extreme weather events on our operations through business continuity planning. This includes the consideration of potential climate impacts in the design and construction of new and upgraded assets and alternate supply chains\n- Extreme health events: the events of COVID-19 this year have impacted globally and have highlighted the need to act early and collectively to mitigate loss, both of life and financial. We also recognise that we must remain prepared to manage these events and support the communities in which we operate with their recovery efforts. We have integrated this into our scenario plans, supply chain reviews and we have stress tested our balance sheet and our financial capacity\n\nThese risks were identified in the Project Sustain Climate Risk workshop.\nAll three time horizons (i.e. short, medium and long term) were considered for each risk e.g. for extreme weather events, we looked at cyclone (short term), droughts (medium term) and climate change (long term).</td>

The impact of climate related risks, including transitional risks and opportunities on the organisation’s businesses, strategy and financial planning are summarised as follows:\n - Water security: Production is dependent on water availability and by addressing transitional risks and responding to scenario planning, we are adapting to a changing water security environment. In the short term we are working toward reducing our water demand and further reusing a greater portion of mine affected water. Medium to long term we are investing in water efficiencies, water recycling and water reuse strategies. \n - Extreme weather events: Contingency plans are embedded in our operations where seasonal weather interrupts operations. We ensure potential climate impacts are considered in our design and construction of new/upgraded assets. We build the resilience of our operations by ensuring we consider alternate supply chains. \n - Energy and Emissions: We remain well-informed of changing regulations, including policy, codes and principles.

The framework reflects our exposure to a variety of uncertainties (both threats and opportunities) that can have financial, operational and compliance impacts on our business performance, reputation and ability to operate successfully. It includes clearly defined oversight responsibilities for the Board, supported by the Risk and Sustainability Committee and support functions, to enable effective risk identification, evaluation and management across Evolution.\n - Long term physical risks that could impact new mining projects are evaluated during the pre-feasibility and feasibility study, and mitigating design features are built into the equipment, layout and intended operations of the project. Risks relating to the development of government policy or legislation to address climate change are monitored by the Group’s Investor Relations and Sustainability teams. Reputational risk arising from changing investor or lender attitudes towards climate change are addressed through effective communication of the Company's underlying growth-oriented strategy and ongoing plans to reduce the environmental impacts of the Company's operations.\n - Refer to Annual and Sustainability Report, in particular the Climate Risk: Risk Management section for more information.</td>

Matters relating to sustainability are recorded in a database and communicated widely across the organisation on daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual timelines dependent on the issue. These are reviewed by our Board Risk and Sustainability Committee throughout the year, supported by regular reviews by the Leadership Team, site leadership teams and subject matter experts such as the TSF Governance Committee.

Evolution is committed to:\n     - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 (Scope 1 and 2 from a FY20 baseline)\n     - Achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (or earlier)\n\nPhysical risks and associated targets\n - In FY22 we measured and analysed our performance (against a FY20 baseline) with the intent to reduce emissions and water intensity for our business.\n\n Emissions data covering the period from FY16 to date is available in the Energy &amp; Emissions worksheet of this document. \n    - Evolution completes assurance reporting on its National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of our submission to NGERS. \n    - Refer to the Annual and Sustainability Report for more information on our material business risks. \n\nThe Balanced Business Plan (BBP) is updated annually to define key goals, measures and targets for the year to deliver against agreed strategic objectives. The remuneration strategy for our short-term incentive payments (STIP) link to ESG elements that include safety, sustainability, risk and people. Performance against our Net Zero future approach has been included in the FY22 STIP program, linked with the new 2030 and 2050 targets. The inclusion of ESG factors within the remuneration strategy reinforces the importance and for us on delivery against ESG by Evolution.\n\nCarbon pricing: Whilst Evolution operations are currently not subject to mandatory carbon pricing for Scope 1 emissions, we acknowledge global and national carbon price trends. Our operations are also subject to an environmental levy payment for Scope 2 emissions.\n\nTo understand the potential financial risks, a robust direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) accounting program has been developed, including setting an emissions baseline. Using the baseline, we have conducted a CO2 abatement cost review focussing on marginal abatement cost curves (MACC). Although our exposure to carbon price is lower than others in the industry due to our lower emissions intensity, we are working on short and long-term plans to decarbonise our operations by 2050. These includes plans to migrate to renewable energy sources and the consideration of renewable fuel, electric fleet and hydrogen fuel adoption. One of the ways we respond to transition risk such as the potential impact of climate change policies on our business is by considering an internal price on carbon and the impacts of climate risk are evaluated as part of life of mine planning. In FY22, we tested distinct price forecasts for Australia and Canada as part of our decarbonisation modelling. While there is a level of risk assumed under different carbon pricing and regulatory scenarios, the opportunity exists to improve Evolution’s competitive position given our GHG emissions performance compared to our peers and our practical strategy in place to enable net zero by 2050.</td>
