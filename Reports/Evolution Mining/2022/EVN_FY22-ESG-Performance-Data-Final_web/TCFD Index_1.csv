,"Describe the resilience of the organizationâs strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2Â°C or lower scenario.","Climate-related risks and opportunities have been included in our strategic planning integrated across our business. The potential likelihood, severity, and materiality of these risks and opportunities to our operations and communities have been proactively assessed and forecasted. They have informed the reporting requirements and targets outlined in the:\n - Site water management plans \n - Emergency management plans\n - Severe Weather Management Plan at Mt Rawdon. \n - Detailed design of the Integrated Waste Landform at Cowal \n \nIn FY22, the Cowal Gold operations was stress tested using climate scenarios relating to energy and emissions and water security. Quantifying these risks has helped inform our business planning and decision making to ensure our asset is resilient to changes in climate.\n\nIn FY23, disclosures will be further strengthened by stress testing all our assets using climate scenarios to identify climate-related financial risks and opportunities.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk\n - Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,
Risk Management,Describe the organizationâs processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.,"- We manage our physical climate risks through our risk management framework which is based on ISO 31000 framework. The framework reflects our exposure to a variety of uncertainties (both threats and opportunities) that can have financial, operational and compliance impacts on our business performance, reputation and ability to operate successfully. It includes clearly defined oversight responsibilities for the Board, supported by the Risk and Sustainability Committee and support functions, to enable effective risk identification, evaluation and management across Evolution.\n - Long term physical risks that could impact new mining projects are evaluated during the pre-feasibility and feasibility study, and mitigating design features are built into the equipment, layout and intended operations of the project. Risks relating to the development of government policy or legislation to address climate change are monitored by the Groupâs Investor Relations and Sustainability teams. Reputational risk arising from changing investor or lender attitudes towards climate change are addressed through effective communication of the Company's underlying growth-oriented strategy and ongoing plans to reduce the environmental impacts of the Company's operations.\n - Refer to Annual and Sustainability Report, in particular the Climate Risk: Risk Management section for more information.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk - Risk Management\n - Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,
,Describe the organizationâs processes for managing climate-related risks.,"- We manage our physical climate risks through our risk management framework which is based on ISO 31000 framework, with specific mining risk also aligned with ICMM protocols. \n - The abovementioned physical risks and uncertainties outlined reflect the risks that could materially affect (negatively or positively) our performance, future prospects or reputation. As such, we set expectations that all our leaders and team members understand their risks, assess them in line with Group policies and procedures, and respond. Where risks are material to the Group, they are escalated to the Board Risk & Sustainability Committee and, as appropriate, to the Board.\n - In FY22 we required each of our operations to implement an Emissions Reduction Plan (a continuation of the Energy and GHG Management Plans in place).\n - Refer to Annual and Sustainability Report, in particular the Climate Risk section for more information.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk\n - Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,
,"Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organizationâs overall risk management.","- We have an established, risk-based decision approach that is supported by the Sustainability and Strategic Planning Policies, Standards, Integrated Risk Management Framework and supporting sites processes and procedures that aligns to the principles of the Australian and international standards and guidance. \n - The Group risk reporting and assurance control mechanisms are designed to ensure strategic, operational, legal, financial, reputational and other risks are identified, assessed and appropriately managed. Matters relating to sustainability are recorded in a database and communicated widely across the organisation on daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual timelines dependent on the issue. These are reviewed by our Board Risk and Sustainability Committee throughout the year, supported by regular reviews by the Leadership Team, site leadership teams and subject matter experts such as the TSF Governance Committee. Further, an integrated three level Line of Defence (LOD) assurance program has been implemented, supported by subject matter experts and internal and external audit.\n\nRefer to Annual and Sustainability Report for Risk Management process.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk\n - Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,
Metrics and Targets,Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process.,"The Company reports Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions data.\n - In June 2021, Evolution announced its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with the climate change goals of the Paris Agreement. Evolution is committed to:\n - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 (Scope 1 and 2 from a FY20 baseline)\n - Achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (or earlier)\n\nPhysical risks and associated targets\n - In FY22 we measured and analysed our performance (against a FY20 baseline) with the intent to reduce emissions and water intensity for our business.\n\n Emissions data covering the period from FY16 to date is available in the Energy & Emissions worksheet of this document. \n - Evolution completes assurance reporting on its National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of our submission to NGERS. \n - Refer to the Annual and Sustainability Report for more information on our material business risks. \n\nThe Balanced Business Plan (BBP) is updated annually to define key goals, measures and targets for the year to deliver against agreed strategic objectives. The remuneration strategy for our short-term incentive payments (STIP) link to ESG elements that include safety, sustainability, risk and people. Performance against our Net Zero future approach has been included in the FY22 STIP program, linked with the new 2030 and 2050 targets. The inclusion of ESG factors within the remuneration strategy reinforces the importance and for us on delivery against ESG by Evolution.\n\nCarbon pricing: Whilst Evolution operations are currently not subject to mandatory carbon pricing for Scope 1 emissions, we acknowledge global and national carbon price trends. Our operations are also subject to an environmental levy payment for Scope 2 emissions.\n\nTo understand the potential financial risks, a robust direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) accounting program has been developed, including setting an emissions baseline. Using the baseline, we have conducted a CO2 abatement cost review focussing on marginal abatement cost curves (MACC). Although our exposure to carbon price is lower than others in the industry due to our lower emissions intensity, we are working on short and long-term plans to decarbonise our operations by 2050. These includes plans to migrate to renewable energy sources and the consideration of renewable fuel, electric fleet and hydrogen fuel adoption. One of the ways we respond to transition risk such as the potential impact of climate change policies on our business is by considering an internal price on carbon and the impacts of climate risk are evaluated as part of life of mine planning. In FY22, we tested distinct price forecasts for Australia and Canada as part of our decarbonisation modelling. While there is a level of risk assumed under different carbon pricing and regulatory scenarios, the opportunity exists to improve Evolutionâs competitive position given our GHG emissions performance compared to our peers and our practical strategy in place to enable net zero by 2050.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk\n - Annual and Sustainability Report: Energy and Emissions\n - This document: Energy & Emissions worksheet; Water Management worksheet,,,,
,"Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks.","- We measure and report on our energy consumption and Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as well as GHG and energy intensity metrics for our sites.\n - Scope 1 emissions mainly relate to mining activities (diesel fuel) and heat energy consumption. Scope 2 emissions are mainly a result of power consumption (Data Source: Greenbase, NPI and NGERS (Australia), NPRI (Canada), GRI).\n - While the gold sector has a more limited exposure to Scope 3 emissions than other industries, our Scope 3 emissions will continue to be tracked and audited and will be fully disclosed in future reports.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk\n - Annual and Sustainability Report: Energy and Emissions,,,,
,Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.,"We are working to build climate related risk resilience in our operations, our communities and our environment through sound risk management practices across all areas in our business.
