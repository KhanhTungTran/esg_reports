9,Risk Management,"Describe the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs processes for identifying and assessing nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities in its direct operations.","- We manage our physical and transitional climate risks, including emissions and water security, through our risk management framework which is based on ISO 31000 framework. The framework reflects our exposure to a variety of uncertainties (both threats and opportunities) that can have financial, operational and compliance impacts on our business performance, reputation and ability to operate successfully. It includes clearly defined oversight responsibilities for the Board, supported by the Risk and Sustainability Committee and support functions, to enable effective risk identification, evaluation and management across Evolution. Management is responsible for the execution, monitoring, measurement, and reporting to the Board Risk and Sustainability Committee at least three times a year.\n - Long term physical risks that could impact new mining projects are evaluated during the pre-feasibility and feasibility study, and mitigating design features are built into the equipment, layout and intended operations of the project.\n- Biodiversity assessments are undertaken in the project planning phase to identify risk of impact biodiversity and mitigation opportunities which inform the development of operational plans at each site in alignment with the Biodiversity Sustainability Performance Standard.\n - Refer to Annual and Sustainability Report, in particular the Climate Risk: Risk Management and Land Use and Biodiversity section for more information.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk - Risk Management; Water Management; Land Use and Biodiversity\n - Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,
10,,"Describe the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs approach to identifying nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities in its upstream and downstream value chain(s) and financed activities and assets.","- In line with our climate-related risk management, including water security, we are committed to mapping our risks along the supply chain and further developing and optimising value chain partnerships as opportunities present.\n- Evolution continues to enhance our understanding of the supply chain beyond the recognised climate-related risks and opportunities identified, and Scope 3 (value chain) emissions.\n- We measure and report on our energy consumption and Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as well as GHG and energy intensity metrics for our sites. This includes detailed historical emissions data to allow for year-on-year trend analysis. All emissions are reported on a monthly basis and are annually independently audited and reported to the relevant regulator.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk - Risk Management; Water Management; Land Use and Biodiversity\n - Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,

12,,"Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing nature-related risks are integrated into the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs overall risk management.","- We have an established, risk-based decision approach that is supported by the Sustainability and Strategic Planning Policies, Standards, an Integrated Risk Management Framework and supporting sites processes and procedures that align to the principles of the Australian, Canadian and international standards and guidance. \n - The Group risk reporting and assurance control mechanisms are designed to ensure strategic, operational, legal, financial, reputational and other risks are identified, assessed and appropriately managed. Matters relating to sustainability are recorded in a database and communicated widely across the organisation on daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual timelines dependent on the issue. These are reviewed by our Board Risk and Sustainability Committee throughout the year, supported by regular reviews by the Leadership Team, site leadership teams and subject matter experts such as the TSF Governance Committee. Further, an integrated three level Line of Defence (LOD) assurance program has been implemented, supported by subject matter experts and internal and third-party audit. Results of these analyses are considered in the review of management plans and formal risk assessments. \n- Various risk management measures have been implemented into climate-related risks, including Water Security, into mainstream risk management plans and processes, for example the pre-wet season planning at Mt Rawdon and Ernest Henry. \n- In an operational context, environmental and biodiversity assessments are undertaken in the project planning phase to identify the risk of the impact biodiversity and mitigation opportunities which inform the development of operational plans at each site in alignment with the Biodiversity Sustainability Performance Standard.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk - Risk Management; Water Management; Land Use and Biodiversity\n - Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,
13,,"Describe how affected stakeholders are engaged by the organisation in its assessment of, and response to, nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities.","The Stakeholder Engagement Performance Standard ensures a consistent approach to engaging with stakeholder including investors, policy makers, local conservation groups, communities, First Nations Partners, employees, contractors, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Each site maintains a systematic stakeholder mapping process, and at intervals, a social impact assessment is completed to identify and prioritise stakeholders from direct and indirect influence areas, and those interested in, or potentially impacted by the operations throughout the entire mine lifecycle. These stakeholders have variable and important interests and impacts on our management of nature-related risks, dependencies and impacts. \n- Our water strategy and operational objectives are informed by robust engagement with a variety of stakeholders. The strategy is under the full authority of Management.\n- Local stakeholders are a valuable sources of knowledge concerning biodiversity, and we work closely with the local communities including First Nation/ Traditional Owners to identify sensitive areas and monitor any potential impacts.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Stakeholder Engagement; Climate Risk - Risk Management; Water Management; Land Use and Biodiversity,,,,

16,,"Describe the targets and goals used by the organisation to manage nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities and its performance against these.","We are actively working to reduce raw water demand to reduce reliance on external water sources and pressure on water sources that support communities and agriculture, and to reduce total water demand through mine design and process improvements. To do so, we aim for a year on year increase reuse of mine affected water in preference to fresh water through design, construction and operation of process plant and tailings facilities; and to increase use of hypersaline and low-quality water not suitable for other industries and communities in preference to fresh water.\n- All data is subject to third-party audit.\n\nBaseline year\n - FY20 was adopted as a baseline year to improve energy efficiency and water security including responsible water management practices, prepare for extreme weather and health events, (including pandemic, smoke impacts from fires, and prolonged wet and dry periods). \n\nTargets\n - Targets have been developed for FY23 to improve energy and emissions and water security, prepare for extreme weather and health events, and adopt responsible water management practices. Specific targets have also been captured in our annual Balanced Business Scorecard, including year on- year reduction of raw water demand per dry tonne milled (0.34) against a FY20 baseline.\n\nPerformance\n - Refer to the Environmental Stewardship and Water Management worksheets in this document for our performance against target.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk - Risk Management; Water Management; Land Use and Biodiversity\n - This document: Environmental Stewardship worksheet; Water Management worksheet,,,,
