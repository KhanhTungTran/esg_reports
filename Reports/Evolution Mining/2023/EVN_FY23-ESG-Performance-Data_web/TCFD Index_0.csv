4,,Describe managementÃ¢ÂÂs role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.,"- In FY19 a set of Sustainability Principles to support our objective of delivering long-term stakeholder value through safe, low-cost gold production in an environmentally and socially responsible manner were adopted by the Board. The Sustainability Principles prescribes nine key focus areas that will ensure sustainability is embedded in our decision making at all levels of the organisation.\n - EvolutionÃ¢ÂÂs Leadership Team is responsible for reviewing climate strategy, risks, governance processes and procedures for the Group, and receives regular updates from the Sustainability Team. \n - Regular risk management training is delivered for all executive and non-executive directors. In 2023 all the Board attended a Risk workshop in June 2023. The Group Manager Safety & Training and Group Manager Risk & Improvement delivered a workshop to train and build further understanding of the Evolution Risk Framework, and to enable the Board to endorse the revised Risk Assessment Matric and material risks, including Climate Change as a material business risk. These revisions had been reviewed and approved by the Leadership Team.\n -The Climate Risk Position statement was first published in FY19 and was reviewed and updated in FY20.\n - Fiona Murfitt, Vice President of Sustainability is responsible for leading Health, Safety, Environment (including Climate Risk), Risk and Social Responsibility (including First Nation engagement) across the portfolio.\n - The Leadership Team meets monthly to discuss operational performance and to ensure key strategic responses to climate-related financial risk and opportunity are being implemented effectively.\n - General Managers of operational sites are responsible for implementing efficiency initiatives to minimise energy consumption.\n - A Resource Efficiency Working Group was established in FY21 to help coordinate and support the execution of strategic climate projects and provide oversight of EvolutionÃ¢ÂÂs abatement activities.\n- In alignment with the Balanced Business Plan, FY23 saw the implementation of the Net Zero Future Project which established a Net Zero Future Steering Committee and Net Zero Future Working Group comprising employees from Group and operations, at all levels including the Leadership Team. It supported the execution of strategic climate and net zero milestones, provide oversight of Evolution's abatement activities, and strengthen internal governance and capability. \n - Management prepare an Annual Sustainability Report for endorsement by the Risk and Sustainability Committee and approval by the Board.\n - The Balanced Business Plan is revised annually to define key goals, measures and targets for their year to deliver against agreed strategic objectives. The remuneration strategy for short-term incentive payments (STIP) is linked to ESG elements that include sustainability, safety, community, risk, emissions and people. Consistent with this approach is the inclusion within the FY23 STIP program was the measurement of performance against our Net Zero future linked with the new 2030 and 2050 approach. The inclusion of ESG factors within the STIP remuneration strategy reinforces the importance of and focus on delivery against ESG by Evolution. \n - Refer to the 'Our Leadership' page for more information on the Board and Leadership Team, and their qualifications and alignment to climate risk.",- Our Leadership\n - Corporate Governance Statement\n - Annual and Sustainability Report: Governance\n - Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk\n- Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,
5,Strategy,"Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term.","Climate related risk was a key element of an internal company funded project, which ran from 2019 to 2021 as a focus on our ongoing commitment to decarbonisation. Climate risk was classified as a material risk area for Evolution in 2019 (note: climate change related risks were outlined in the 2019 Evolution Risk Register). Climate risk was also identified as a high material issue in the formal materiality assessment conducted in early 2021. In FY23, following a review of the Evolution Risk Framework, Climate Change was again endorsed as a material risk to the business. We evaluate and monitor the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our businesses and corporate plans over a range of time horizons, and the Board, through the Risk & Sustainability Committee, monitors progress every three months.\n\nThe Company consider short, medium, and long-term risks as noted below: \n - Short-term risks: risks which may materialise in the current annual reporting period \n - Medium-term risks: risks that may materialise over a 2-5-year timeframe\n - Long-term risks: risks which may fundamentally impact the viability of our long-term business strategy and our legacy extending 5-10-20 years \n\nThe climate-related physical risks identified as applicable to our business are as follows:\n - Energy and emissions: We keep informed of changing regulations, including policy, codes and principles to help manage transition risk. We engage with our community and stakeholders to ensure we are operating with a holistic mindset. We remain agile in response to changing markets and explore innovative technology including renewables to improve our resilience to resource financial and supply uncertainty. We aim to contribute positively to local, regional and national sustainability efforts\n - Water security: Production is reliant on the availability of water. In the short term, the Group is adapting to a changing water security environment by working towards reducing demand and reusing a greater portion of water. In the medium to long term, we are investing in water recycling and reuse strategies to improve efficiencies\n - Extreme weather events: We ensure we minimise the impact of extreme weather events on our operations through business continuity planning. This includes the consideration of potential climate impacts in the design and construction of new and upgraded assets and alternate supply chains\n- Extreme health events: the events of COVID-19 continue to have a legacy with global impacts, and it has highlighted the need to act early and collectively to mitigate loss, both of life and financial. We also recognise that we must remain prepared to manage these events and support the communities in which we operate with their recovery efforts. We have integrated this into our scenario plans, supply chain reviews and we have stress tested our balance sheet and our financial capacity\n\nThese risks were identified in the Project Sustain Climate Risk workshop, and continue to be reaffirmed during climate scenario analyses, planning and modelling at our sites. \nAll three time horizons (i.e. short, medium and long term) were considered for each risk e.g. for extreme weather events, we looked at cyclone (short term), droughts (medium term) and climate change (long term).",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk; Sustainability Performance Standards and Strategic Planning Standards; Materiality Assessment\n - Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,
6,,"Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organizationÃ¢ÂÂs businesses, strategy, and financial planning.","The Climate Risk Position Statement was reviewed in FY20. The impact of climate related risks, including transitional risks and opportunities on the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs businesses, strategy and financial planning are summarised as follows:\n - Water security: Production is dependent on water availability and by addressing transitional risks and responding to scenario planning, we are adapting to a changing water security environment. In the short term we are working toward reducing our water demand and further reusing a greater portion of mine affected water. Medium to long term we are investing in water efficiencies, water recycling and water reuse strategies. \n - Extreme weather events: Contingency plans are embedded in our operations where seasonal weather interrupts operations. We ensure potential climate impacts are considered in our design and construction of new/upgraded assets. We build the resilience of our operations by ensuring we consider alternate supply chains. \n - Energy and Emissions: We remain well-informed of changing regulations, including policy, codes and principles, including carbon pricing. We engage with our community and stakeholders to ensure we are operating with a holistic mindset. We remain agile in response to changing markets and explore innovative technology to improve our resilience to resource financial and supply uncertainty. We aim to contribute positively to local, regional and national sustainability efforts.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk\n - Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,
