3,Governance,"Describe the board's oversight of nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities.","- The Board maintains oversight of nature-related risks and opportunities, dependencies and impacts, by delegating responsibility to the Risk and Sustainability Committee. The primary responsibility of the Risk and Sustainability Committee is to oversee the CompanyÃ¢ÂÂs Operational risk management systems, sustainability programs and mitigating controls on behalf of the Board and regularly providing a report of its activities to the Board.\n- The role of the Risk and Sustainability Committee is to advise and support the Board of Directors on all matters pertaining to the Sustainability of the Company and Group level risk appetite, risk management, and mitigation of all Operational material risks arising from the CompanyÃ¢ÂÂs activities, including nature-related risk and opportunities. \n- This Committee is comprised of Independent Non-Executive Directors and is appointed by the Board on whose behalf it acts, and to whom it reports at least three times per year on risk management activities and recommendations. \n- In assisting the Board, the Committee oversees the management of nature-related risks and opportunities by regular review of internal compliance programs and externally applicable sustainability codes and principles, including: periodically visiting Company; reviewing and monitoring risk management processes and standards to ensure all material risks are identified and that appropriate risk mitigation, controls and assurance processes are effectively in place; reviewing and monitoring environmental contingency planning which are designed for all material environmental risks; and reviewing and monitoring the plans, activities and corrective actions in place designed to ensure that there is appropriate engagement with communities and First Nation partners impacted by the Company's operations.\n- The Executive Chair is responsible for our water management strategy and performance.\n - Refer to the 'Risk and Sustainability Committee Charter' for more information on the roles and responsibilities of the Committee and the Board.",- Our Leadership\n- Risk and Sustainability Committee Charter\n - Corporate Governance Statement\n - Annual and Sustainability Report: Governance\n - Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk; Water Management; Land Use and Biodiversity\n- Climate Risk Position Statement \n - Annual and Sustainability Report: Director's Report,,,,
4,,"Describe management's role in assessing and managing nature-related dependencies, impacts, risk and opportunities.","- Management is responsible for developing, implementing and executing the strategy related to nature related risk. Responsible executives have been identified for these material risks and these executives report directly to the CEO. \n- The performance and ongoing management of these risk remains with Management who have oversight of the execution at a site level \n- Supporting this is a set of Sustainability Principles implemented in FY19 to support our objective of delivering long-term stakeholder value through safe, low-cost gold production in an environmentally and socially responsible way. The Sustainability Principles prescribes nine key focus areas (linked to UNSDGs) that ensure sustainability is embedded in our decision making at all levels of the organisation and is linked directly to the Company Strategy. \n- The development and implementation of our Sustainability goals, policies and standards on matters of climate risk and environmental management and managed by the Leadership team with specific authority over Performance standards, policies, and procedures sitting with the appointed Executive reporting to the CEO. The Risk and Sustainability Committee oversees the performance of these are defined by their Charter.\n - EvolutionÃ¢ÂÂs Leadership Team is responsible for developing the sustainability strategy, risks, governance processes and procedures for the Group, and receives regular updates from the Sustainability Team and broader business. \n- Fiona Murfitt, Vice President of Sustainability is responsible for leading Health, Safety, Environment (including nature-related Risk), Risk and Social Responsibility (including First Nation engagement) across the portfolio, reporting to the CEO and interfacing directly with the Chair of the Risk and Sustainability Committee delegated by the Board.\n- A structured risk management framework is applied aligned with international standards. Risks are regularly reviewed and assessed for their adequacy of controls which are updated in the relevant risk registers also reviewed at all levels of the business.\n - The Leadership Team regularly (as a minimum weekly and formally monthly) to discuss operational performance supported by auditable documentation.\n - Refer to the 'Our Leadership' page for more information on the Board and Leadership Team, and their qualifications and alignment to nature-related risk.",- Our Leadership\n - Corporate Governance Statement\n - Annual and Sustainability Report: Governance\n - Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk; Water Management; Land Use and Biodiversity\n- Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,
5,Strategy,"Describe the nature-related dependencies, impacts, and risk and opportunities the organisation has identified over the short, medium, and long term.","- Land Use, Biodiversity and Water Management were identified as a high material matters in the formal materiality assessment conducted in early 2021 with internal and external stakeholders. It is also included on the Group Risk register as a material risk under ""Water Management"", with the accountable executive being the Vice President of Sustainability reporting to the CEO. This was updated and endorsed by the Board in FY23. \n- The Sustainability and Strategic Planning Policy supported by the respective Standards set out to define and demonstrate robust risk management and environmental stewardship to mitigate threats, whilst exploiting opportunities to create value for the business and our stakeholders.\n- Risk management (including that of climate change related risks) is embedded into the day-to-day operational business processes and is a Board endorsed statement. All material risks and actions are documented and kept current for managing and reporting purposes. \n- Our risk assessment process is founded on site-specific exposures and potential vulnerabilities. In line with our Sustainability strategy of ""Integrated into everything we do"", we deliver disciplined, consistent, and reliable management in our risk management approach, including the management of our environmental footprint. Biodiversity assessments are undertaken in the project planning phase to identify risk of impact biodiversity and mitigation opportunities which inform the development of operational plans at each site in alignment with the standard. Our biodiversity strategy is linked to the stage of development of projects which is also evaluated at all levels of the life of mine cycle. \n- We strive to apply the mitigation hierarchy with the ambition of no net loss in protecting biodiversity and ecosystems. We do not conduct exploration or mining operations in protected areas and commit to the protection of World Heritage Sites.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk; Water Management; Land Use and Biodiversity; Sustainability and Strategic Planning Policy; Sustainability Performance Standards and Strategic Planning Standards; Materiality Assessment,,,,
6,,"Describe how nature-related risks and opportunities identified in Strategy A have affected its businesses, strategy and financial planning","- The Sustainability and Strategic Planning Policy and supporting Standards outline how Sustainability is integrated into every aspect of the business to ensure we deliver long-term stakeholder value through safe, reliable, low-cost gold production in an environmentally and socially responsible way. This involves a commitment to reduce our environmental footprint. \n- Sensitive flora and fauna are only impacted where the internal and external risk assessments and permitting processes have been evaluated, approved and met (and no other alternative is available).",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk; Water Management; Land Use and Biodiversity,,,,
7,,"Describe the resilience of the organisation's strategy, tracking into consideration different scenarios.","- In FY23, a gap analysis of Evolution's business-wide performance against TNFD (V0.4) was undertaken by an external consultant. As the TNFD Framework is formalised from its current beta status, Evolution is committed to addressing recommendations from this gap analysis to enhance our risk assessment of nature-related risks and opportunities, including scenario planning and modelling. \n- Currently, Evolution has undertaken climate scenario analysis aligned with the recommendations of the TCFD. In FY22, the Cowal Gold operations was stress tested using climate scenarios relating to energy and emissions and water security. In FY23, the Mungari Gold operation was also stress tested using climate scenarios relating to energy and emissions and extreme weather events (storms). Both scenario analysis have considered water-related risks and impacts to productivity and the value chain. Climate-related risks and opportunities have been included in the strategic planning integrated across the business.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk; Water Management; Land Use and Biodiversity,,,,
8,,"Describe the organization's interactions with low integrity ecosystems, high importance ecosystems or areas of water stress.","- Our sites are in a range of climatic zones with varying vulnerabilities to both acute and chronic physical risks, including disasters; changes in the patterns and intensity of rainfall and storms, and water shortages. Ecosystem and species of concern are identified at site level and these are also audited and reviewed at a Group level linked to the application of the Biodiversity Standards. \n- No Evolution operations are in high to extremely high baseline water stress areas according to definitions set in the WBCSD Global Water Tool, WRI Aqueduct Global Water Tool or Water Footprint Network.\n- The Climate Risk Position Statement was reviewed and updated in FY23. The impact of climate related risks, including transitional risks and opportunities on the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs businesses, strategy and financial planning are summarised as follows:\n- Water security: Production is dependent on water availability and by addressing transitional risks and responding to scenario planning, we are adapting to a changing water security environment. In the short term we are working toward reducing our water demand and further reusing a greater portion of mine affected water. Medium to long term we are investing in water efficiencies, water recycling and water reuse strategies. \n- Mitigating this risk is informed by our water strategy. It is guided by robust stakeholder engagement with stakeholders such as investors, policymakers, non-government organisations and communities. It focusses on optimising water consumption, reducing reliance on fresh water, maximising reuse of mine affected water (MAW) to reduce competition in external raw water demand with agricultural and other industries and communities, and minimising the potential for operational impacts on water quality.",- Annual and Sustainability Report: Climate Risk; Water Management; Land Use and Biodiversity\n- This document: Environmental Stewardship; Water Management Worksheet\n - Climate Risk Position Statement,,,,
