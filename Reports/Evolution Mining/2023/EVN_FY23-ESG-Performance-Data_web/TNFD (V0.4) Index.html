It is also included on the Group Risk register as a material risk under "Water Management", with the accountable executive being the Vice President of Sustainability reporting to the CEO. This was updated and endorsed by the Board in FY23. \n- The Sustainability and Strategic Planning Policy supported by the respective Standards set out to define and demonstrate robust risk management and environmental stewardship to mitigate threats, whilst exploiting opportunities to create value for the business and our stakeholders.\n- Risk management (including that of climate change related risks) is embedded into the day-to-day operational business processes and is a Board endorsed statement. All material risks and actions are documented and kept current for managing and reporting purposes. \n- Our risk assessment process is founded on site-specific exposures and potential vulnerabilities. In line with our Sustainability strategy of "Integrated into everything we do", we deliver disciplined, consistent, and reliable management  in our risk management approach, including the management of our environmental footprint. Biodiversity assessments are undertaken in the project planning phase to identify risk of impact biodiversity and mitigation opportunities which inform the development of operational plans at each site in alignment with the standard. Our biodiversity strategy is linked to the stage of development of projects which is also evaluated at all levels of the life of mine cycle. \n- We strive to apply the mitigation hierarchy with the ambition of no net loss in protecting biodiversity and ecosystems. We do not conduct exploration or mining operations in protected areas and commit to the protection of World Heritage Sites.</td>

As the TNFD Framework is formalised from its current beta status, Evolution is committed to addressing recommendations from this gap analysis to enhance our risk assessment of nature-related risks and opportunities, including scenario planning and modelling. \n- Currently, Evolution has undertaken climate scenario analysis aligned with the recommendations of the TCFD. In FY22, the Cowal Gold operations was stress tested using climate scenarios relating to energy and emissions and water security. In FY23, the Mungari Gold operation was also stress tested using climate scenarios relating to energy and emissions and extreme weather events (storms). Both scenario analysis have considered water-related risks and impacts to productivity and the value chain. Climate-related risks and opportunities have been included in the strategic planning integrated across the business.</td>

Ecosystem and species of concern are identified at site level and these are also audited and reviewed at a Group level linked to the application of the Biodiversity Standards.  \n- No Evolution operations are in high to extremely high baseline water stress areas according to definitions set in the WBCSD Global Water Tool, WRI Aqueduct Global Water Tool or Water Footprint Network.\n- The Climate Risk Position Statement was reviewed and updated in FY23. The impact of climate related risks, including transitional risks and opportunities on the organisation’s businesses, strategy and financial planning are summarised as follows:\n- Water security: Production is dependent on water availability and by addressing transitional risks and responding to scenario planning, we are adapting to a changing water security environment. In the short term we are working toward reducing our water demand and further reusing a greater portion of mine affected water. Medium to long term we are investing in water efficiencies, water recycling and water reuse strategies. \n- Mitigating this risk is informed by our water strategy. It is guided by robust stakeholder engagement with stakeholders such as investors, policymakers, non-government organisations and communities. It focusses on optimising water consumption, reducing reliance on fresh water, maximising reuse of mine affected water (MAW) to reduce competition in external raw water demand with agricultural and other industries and communities, and minimising the potential for operational impacts on water quality.</td>

Matters relating to sustainability are recorded in a database and communicated widely across the organisation on daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual timelines dependent on the issue. These are reviewed by our Board Risk and Sustainability Committee throughout the year, supported by regular reviews by the Leadership Team, site leadership teams and subject matter experts such as the TSF Governance Committee. Further, an integrated three level Line of Defence (LOD) assurance program has been implemented, supported by subject matter experts and internal and third-party audit. Results of these analyses are considered in the review of management plans and formal risk assessments. \n- Various risk management measures have been implemented into climate-related risks, including Water Security, into mainstream risk management plans and processes, for example the pre-wet season planning at Mt Rawdon and Ernest Henry. \n- In an operational context, environmental and biodiversity assessments are undertaken in the project planning phase to identify the risk of the impact biodiversity and mitigation opportunities which inform the development of operational plans at each site in alignment with the Biodiversity Sustainability Performance Standard.</td>
