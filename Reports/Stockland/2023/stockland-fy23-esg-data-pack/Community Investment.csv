,Background Notes,,,,
,"Our community data presents the total value of our strategic community investment activities delivered via:
• 	community development – our strategic approach to delivering infrastructure and social programs in partnership with not-for-profit organisations in the areas in and around our assets. 
• 	community investment – our long-term strategic involvement in community partnerships and programs that address social issues and opportunities through employee engagement programs.
• 	The Stockland CARE Foundation – a charitable trust established for the purposes of improving the health, wellbeing and education of Australian communities. 

We report our community data holistically, given that our approach to investing in our community is consistent across all our business units. We do however provide breakdowns by business units when discussing investments and initiatives at asset level.",,,,
