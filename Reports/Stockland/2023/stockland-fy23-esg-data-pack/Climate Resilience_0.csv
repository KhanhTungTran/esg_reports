0,,CLIMATE RESILIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,
2,,"Our climate resilience assessment methodology assesses the resilience of individual properties and their communities. It focuses on the vulnerability of our assets to climate change, particularly their ability to endure severe weather impacts and operate without disruption. Key resilience criteria includes location and design, structure, operation and maintenance, utilities and services, and stakeholders. The assessment of each of these components are combined to provide an overall climate resilience score on a scale of 1 to 25, from outstanding resilience to high vulnerability (see table below).",,,,,,,,,,,
4,,Classification,Score,Description,,,,,,,,,
5,,Outstanding resilience,0 to 4,Asset has inherent adaptive capacity and very low sensitivity to climate hazards. It is likely to have implemented a number of adaptation strategies to greatly improve tolerance to climate hazards. Asset is not likely to be located in a region which is exposed to climate hazards and to date has responded well to the changing climate.,,,,,,,,,
6,,High resilience,4 to 9,"Asset has good adaptive capacity and low sensitivity to climate hazards. It is likely to have implemented some adaptation strategies to improve tolerance to climate hazards. Asset is not likely to be located in a region which is exposed to climate hazards, however it may have a limited number of potential impacts to address to maintain resilience.",,,,,,,,,
7,,Moderate resilience,9 to 16,Asset has moderate adaptive capacity and sensitivity to climate hazards. It is likely to have implemented a limited number of adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability to climate hazards. Asset is likely to be located in a region which is exposed to climate hazards and has nominal potential impacts to address to improve resilience.,,,,,,,,,
8,,High vulnerability,16 to 25,Asset has a low level of adaptive capacity and high sensitivity to climate hazards. It is very unlikely to have implemented adaptation strategies to improve tolerance to climate hazards. Asset is very likely to be located in a region which is highly exposed to multiple climate hazards and has a number of potential impacts to address to reduce vulnerability.,,,,,,,,,
