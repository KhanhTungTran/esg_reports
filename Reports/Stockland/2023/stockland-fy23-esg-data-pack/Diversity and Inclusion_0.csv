41,,1. Average fixed remuneration ratio looks at the ratio of the average female fixed pay to the average male fixed pay by job band. Casual employees are not included in the calculation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

46,,Gender pay equity ratio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,,The methodology of measuring pay equity is limited if based solely on average fixed pay by job band as it ignores different market values placed on different jobs. A better and more accurate process is to assess gender pay equity by considering an individualÃ¢ÂÂs positioning against the relevant market benchmark. This analysis is shown below in the gender pay equity ratio table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

52,,"1. The gender pay equity ratio is calculated by dividing the female compa-ratio by the male compa-ratio for employees. Compa-ratio represents the ratio of employeesÃ¢ÂÂ Fixed Pay to the median of the applicable benchmark. For example, if an employeeÃ¢ÂÂs Fixed Pay is $120,000 and the market mid-point is $100,000, the compa-ratio versus the median of the applicable benchmark is 120% ($120,000 / $100,000). An employeeÃ¢ÂÂs position against the applicable benchmark will vary based on relative experience and skills. If a female has a compa-ratio of 102% and a male has a compa-ratio of 104%, then the gender pay equity ratio would be 98%. A gender pay equity ratio that is less than 100% suggests that males are better positioned against market in comparison to females, whereas a gender pay equity ratio that is 100% or higher suggests that females are equally or better positioned against market in comparison to males.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
