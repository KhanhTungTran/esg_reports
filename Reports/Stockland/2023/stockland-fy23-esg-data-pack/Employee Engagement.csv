,* Turnover presents the proportion of the Stockland workforce that has exited in the last 12 months. It is calculated by dividing [Total Number Of Exits In The Last 12 Months] by [12-Month Average Headcount]. All turnover data (including headcount) excludes those employed on a casual or fixed term basis. The first number represents this turnover. Stockland reports on the number of exits (the second number in parentheses).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,1. In FY20 the methodology and data exports for calculating turnover was changed. The FY19 data has been updated using the new methodology and data sets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2. Employee-initiated turnover includes resignations and retirements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
