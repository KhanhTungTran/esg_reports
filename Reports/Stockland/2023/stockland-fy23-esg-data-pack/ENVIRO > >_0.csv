In FY23, Stockland completed a review of how we measure positive and negative impacts on biodiversity associated with our developments. We found that there have been advances in relation to the quantification of biodiversity outcomes since we first deployed our proprietary biodiversity calculator in 2015. Following this review, Stockland has started work on the development of an updated calculator and approach to tracking biodiversity outcomes associated with our developments. We aim to revise our biodiversity target in line with emerging definitions for biodiversity impacts.",,l,,,,
