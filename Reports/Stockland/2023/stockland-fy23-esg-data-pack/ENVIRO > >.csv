,,Communities,"For new Masterplanned Communities, make an aggregated net positive contribution to the biodiversity value by FY24 as determined by th biodiversity calculator.",,,,,"There were no new Masterplanned Communities that reached Stage 3 of D-Life and were over 500 lots in FY23, and therefore no biodiversity calculators performed. In FY23, Stockland completed a review of how we measure positive and negative impacts on biodiversity associated with our developments. We found that there have been advances in relation to the quantification of biodiversity outcomes since we first deployed our  proprietary biodiversity calculator in 2015. Following this review, Stockland has started work on the development of  an updated calculator and approach to tracking biodiversity  outcomes associated with our developments. We aim to revise our biodiversity target in line with emerging definitions for biodiversity impacts.",,l,,,,
