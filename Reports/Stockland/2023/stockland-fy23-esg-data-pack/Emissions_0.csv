11,,"3. In FY23, a system error was identified where solar energy had been incorrectly recorded historically. In instances where solar generation was greater than StocklandÃ¢ÂÂs common area consumption, the system was inaccurately attributing excess solar energy as negative consumption and not offsetting the tenant consumption. This resulted in reduced scope 2 emissions for certain periods. Where required, Stockland has recalculated and restated its energy consumption and emissions from FY19-FY22. For comparison to prior year statements please see the table to the right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
