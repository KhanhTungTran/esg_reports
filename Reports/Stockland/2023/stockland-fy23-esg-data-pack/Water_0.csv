32,,"2. Residential contractor water data varies from year to year due to activities such as dust suppression and abnormal usage (e.g. filling lakes) in large developments, as well as location-specific variables such as natural rainfall, project life cycles, market conditions, site management techniques and local landscaping requirements set by councils. Furthermore, contractors self-report water data, which means we do not review each contractorÃ¢ÂÂs data collection processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
