73,,The sum of the categories may be slightly different to the Rio Tinto total due to rounding.,,,,,,,
74,,Aggregated totals are the sum of data for all assets within the reporting group. No adjustments have been applied to discount water that moves between assets within the same reporting group. Some totals may therefore be conservatively stated.,,,,,,,
