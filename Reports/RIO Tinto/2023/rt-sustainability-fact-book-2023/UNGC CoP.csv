,"Rio Tinto has supported the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) since its inception more than 20 years ago. We value the UNGC’s leadership in promoting the private sector’s contribution to realisation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and addressing climate change. We reviewed our approach to the UN SDGs to identify how we can work more effectively with governments, civil society and others to pursue meaningful impact on development. We decided to primarily focus on the two lead goals – SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) – that we feel are most aligned to operating our business responsibly and where we can make our greatest impact. 

In 2021, Rio Tinto submitted its UNGC CoP for 2020 and 2021. Our UNGC CoP submission was reported in the Sustainability Fact Book as well as on the UNGC website. The UNGC CoP reporting system changed in 2023 (requiring the submission of responses to the UNGC questionnaire in the online portal). Our submission applied to Rio Tinto's 2022 reporting period (01 Jan - 31 Dec 2022). Rio Tinto's responses to the UNGC CoP questionnaire were submitted through the UNGC portal and published under Rio Tinto's company profile on the UNGC website: https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants.

For more information on how we are supporting and implementing the ten principles of the UNGC, refer to the table below.
