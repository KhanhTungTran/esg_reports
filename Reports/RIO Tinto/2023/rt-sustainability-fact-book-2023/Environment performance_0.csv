4,,"As environmental stewards, we focus on responsibly managing shared resources to protect the health, safety and livelihoods of local communities. We manage risk to minimise adverse environmental impacts from our operations and to sustain our shared ecosystems, planet and natural resources for future generations. \n\nIn 2023, we continued the independent review of monitoring programs at our high-priority biodiversity sites. This involved ensuring management plans and actions adequately address biodiversity risks. We completed this review at our Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) site in 2023, with further efforts planned for 2024. Also in 2023, we rehabilitated 22 square kilometres of land, mostly at our iron ore mines and exploration areas in the Pilbara, Western Australia and our mineral sands mines in South Africa and Madagascar. Of this, we rehabilitated 4.5 square kilometres of ex-pit landforms and legacy areas across our Pilbara mines. This is part of our Iron Ore businessÃ¢ÂÂs plan to increase rehabilitation, in partnership with Pilbara Aboriginal businesses. Since 2021, we have completed 24 square kilometres of land rehabilitation across our Pilbara mine operations. In Mongolia, we have rehabilitated 4 square kilometres of abandoned mine workings based outside our operational footprint, along valley floors and river beds in the Selenge province. This is a part of Oyu TolgoiÃ¢ÂÂs commitment to the Government of MongoliaÃ¢ÂÂs national movement to plant one billion trees by 2030.",,,,,,
