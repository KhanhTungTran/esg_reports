119,,"Significant environmental incident is an incident with an actual consequence rating of high or very high. We measure and rate incidents according to their actual environmental and compliance impacts using five severity categories: very low, low, moderate, high and very high. Very high and high environmental incidents are usually reported to the relevant product group head and the Rio Tinto Chief Executive as soon as possible. The severity categories were updated for incident reporting in 2023 based on changes to Rio Tinto's risk matrix and associated environment consequence descriptors.",,,,,,
