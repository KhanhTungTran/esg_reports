4,,"Our operational emissions targets are ambitious - to reduce emissions by 15% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 relative to 2018 levels, reaching net zero by 2050. Our targets cover more than 95% of our reported Scope 1 and 2 emissions and are aligned with 1.5ÃÂ°C pathways. We adjust our baseline to exclude reductions achieved by divesting assets and to account for acquisitions. \n\nOur definition of net zero applies to our operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions on an equity basis. To reach net zero we will need to decarbonise our operations as far as technically and commercially practical, and address all the remaining emissions with carbon dioxide removals from the atmosphere and long-term storage. To tackle our Scope 3 emissions across our value chains we are committed to helping our customers and suppliers achieve their targets a decade earlier - reaching net zero by 2050. In particular, we continue to work with our customers to develop and scale up the technologies to decarbonise steel and aluminium production.",,,,,,,,,,,

35,,"Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) is 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20% owned by Rusal. However, as a result of QAL's activation of a step-in process following the Australian GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs sanction measures, Rio Tinto is currently entitled to utilise 100% of the capacity at QAL, but paying 100% of the costs for as long as that step-in continues. Our 2023 equity emissions and our 2018 baseline include QAL emissions on the basis of Rio TintoÃ¢ÂÂs 80% ownership. In 2023, the additional emissions associated with the step-in were 0.8Mt. Rusal has commenced proceedings challenging the validity of the step-in and the sanctions regime may change over time, such that the duration of the step-in remains uncertain. Historical Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been restated to reflect improvements in data quality.",,,,,,,,,,,
