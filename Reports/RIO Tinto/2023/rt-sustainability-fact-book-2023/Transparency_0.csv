3,,TRANSPARENCY,
4,,"Transparency encourages accountability Ã¢ÂÂ ours as well as othersÃ¢ÂÂ. Being open and transparent about our tax payments, mineral development contracts, beneficial ownership and our stance on a range of other sustainability issues, such as climate change, allows us to enter into open, fact-based conversations with our stakeholders. This provides a better understanding of everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs roles and responsibilities.Ã¢ÂÂ¯\nWe are recognised as a leader in transparent tax reporting. We are a founding member of the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) and have actively supported EITIÃ¢ÂÂs principles and global transparency and accountability standards since 2003. We are also a signatory to the B Team Responsible Tax Principles. Ã¢ÂÂ¯\n\nWe take part in a number of global, national and regional organisations and initiatives that inform our sustainability approach and standards, which in turn allows us to better manage our risks. These independent organisations and initiatives assess and recognise our performance, and we participate in industry accreditation programs for some of our products.",
