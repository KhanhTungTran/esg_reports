,VALUE CHAIN,,,,,
,"As consumers become more mindful of the sustainability of the products they choose, they want reassurance that the materials consumed reflect responsible practices throughout the value chain. Materials used in products today may not be the preferred choice in the future if they cannot establish their environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials or develop strong circular solutions. This starts with transparency and includes our suppliers, operations, and customers. Our Supplier Code of Conduct lays out our expectations on human and labour rights, safety and environment and our global supply contract outlines our expectations for how our suppliers should manage modern slavery risks.

In our operations, we are providing our customers with assurance that our value chain is responsible through independent industry stewardship programs. Our Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi copper operations have been awarded the Copper Mark, the copper industry’s independently assessed responsible production program. In 2021, our ISAL smelter in Iceland was certified under the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative, joining other aluminium assets in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Our three Canadian mines – Diavik Diamond Mine, Iron Ore Company of Canada and RTIT Quebec Operations HSP mine – are assured under the Towards Sustainable Mining program.",,,,,
