4,,"We have a long history of partnering to support the host communities and regions where we operate. We employ local people, buy local products, and engage local services. In 2023, our total voluntary global social investment was $84 million, covering a wide range of social and economic programs. And we introduced a new company-wide approach to social investment, which focuses on working together with communities to find out what is important to them so we can make decisions that will deliver positive and enduring outcomes. This is essential for our continued social licence in an increasingly complex world.\n\nAt Oyu Tolgoi, we strive to be a leader in sustainable social and economic change through partnerships with local communities and government. Since 2015, we have made an annual contribution to the regional Development Support Fund (DSF) Ã¢ÂÂ administered jointly by Oyu Tolgoi and the community Ã¢ÂÂ for community initiatives in the Umnugovi aimag. In 2023, the fund provided $6.2 million to help complete a local school, kindergarten and health care centre and construct sewage pipelines, pasture irrigation, waste plant and rare animal protection projects. This has improved accessibility and provided a better standard of living for community members.",,,,,,
