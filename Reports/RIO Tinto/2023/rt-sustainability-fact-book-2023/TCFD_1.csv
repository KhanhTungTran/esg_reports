14,,,"Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 GHG emissions, and the related risks.","Organisations should provide their Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions independent of a materiality assessment and, if appropriate, Scope 3 GHG emissions and the related risks.

In addition, where not apparent, organisations should provide a description of the methodologies used to calculate or estimate the metrics.",,"See Climate change section:\n\tÃ¢ÂÂ Climate-related metrics and targets, page 55.\n\nReference to our GHG emissions are also made throughout the Annual Report, including on pages 22 and 150."
15,,,Describe the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.,"Organisations should describe their key climate-related targets such as those related to GHG emissions, water usage, energy usage etc, in line with the cross-industry, climate-related metric categories, where relevant, and in line with anticipated regulatory requirements or market constraints or other goals. Other goals may include efficiency or financial goals, financial loss tolerances, avoided GHG emissions through the entire product life cycle, or net revenue goals for products and services designed for a low-carbon economy.\n\nIn describing their targets, organisations should consider including the following:\n\tÃ¢ÂÂ Whether the target is absolute or intensity based.\n\tÃ¢ÂÂ Time frames over which the target applies.\n\tÃ¢ÂÂ Base year from which progress is measured.\n\tÃ¢ÂÂ Key performance indicators used to assess progress against targets.\n\nOrganisations disclosing medium-term or long-term targets should also disclose associated interim targets in aggregate or by business line, where available.

19,,Strategy,"Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs businesses, strategy, \nand financial planning.","Organisations should consider discussing how climate-related risks and opportunities are integrated into their (1) current decision making and (2) strategy formulation, including planning assumptions and objectives around climate change mitigation, adaptation, or opportunities such as:\n\tÃ¢ÂÂ research and development and adoption of new technology\n\tÃ¢ÂÂ existing and committed future activities such as investments, restructuring, write-downs, or impairment of assets\n\tÃ¢ÂÂ critical planning assumptions around legacy assets, for example strategies to lower carbon-, energy-/water-intensive operations.\n\tÃ¢ÂÂ how GHG emissions, energy, and water issues, if applicable, are considered in capital planning and allocation.
