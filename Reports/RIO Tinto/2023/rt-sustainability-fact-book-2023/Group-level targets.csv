,"1. While we expect to have made financial commitments to abatement projects totalling more than 15% of our emissions by 2025, achieved emissions reductions will lag this.",
,"2. We take a “site-centric” view of the definition of local, which allows operations to establish their own definition, based on a set of common principles. These principles require that each operation, in defining “local” takes into consideration its geographic, social and economic area of impact as well as ownership. For example, suppliers located within the Pilbara region of Western Australia are defined as “local” for Rio Tinto Iron Ore’s Pilbara Operations. This approach is consistent with international best practice and aligns with the ICMM Social and Economic Reporting Framework guidance.",
,"3. The cultural heritage co-management maturity framework sets out a maturity model consisting of five levels of maturity – from ""learning the practice"" to ""leading practice"". There are six categories against which a site will be evaluated to determine its level of maturity, covering various aspects of cultural heritage management. ",
