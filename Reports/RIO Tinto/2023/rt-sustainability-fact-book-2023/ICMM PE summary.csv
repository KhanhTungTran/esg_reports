,ICMM - Performance Expectations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"As a founding member of the ICMM, Rio Tinto has committed to completing our implementation of the ICMM Performance Expectations (PEs). The ICMM Mining Principles framework focuses on implementation of systems and practices related to a broad range of sustainability areas. In line with ICMM requirements, all 29 Rio Tinto-managed operating and refining assets completed an ICMM PE self-assessment before 30 September 2022. A self-assessment was also completed for Rio Tinto Corporate. 

In 2022, Rio Tinto prioritised 26 of the 29 operating assets for validation in the initial three-year cycle based on the following criteria:
•  Integrated assurance schedule: Rio Tinto is taking an integrated approach to the ESG assurance program, which will commence in 2023. Integrated assurance refers to an asset completing one assurance activity to respond to multiple different frameworks. The integrated assurance schedule aligns all of Rio Tinto’s ESG certifications and membership commitments such that they will be conducted as an integrated assurance activity over a three-year assurance cycle.
•  Operating/refining assets risk and size considerations: The three assets that will not be prioritised in this initial three-year validation cycle include Wilmington; Coudekerque and Suzhou. They were not prioritised for this validation cycle due to the nature of the operations and as many of the PEs were self-assessed and calibrated by an experienced Validation Service Provider (VSP), ERM Canada as “Not Applicable”. In addition, all three operations have a workforce below 100 full-time equivalents.

In 2023, on-site third-party validations were completed for 12 of our priority operating and refining assets and included validation of the Rio Tinto corporate self-assessment. As of 9 February 2024, we have received validation reports for three sites; Oyu Tolgoi (OT), Rio Tinto Kennecott (RTK) and Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC). The remaining nine sites were assessed in late 2023 and the final reports are still pending. The validation outcomes for these sites will be disclosed in the 2024 Sustainability Fact Book. The validation reports received to date indicate alignment between the self-assessment and validation outcomes, with identification of relevant areas for improvement. 

The results presented in the table below reflect the most recent self-assessments. For sites that have completed third-party validation and received their final reports, the results presented in the table below reflect the validated outcomes.

The possible outcomes for the validation of an individual PE are ‘Meets’, ‘Partially meets’, and ‘Does not meet’ as defined below:
• Meets: Systems and/or practices related to the PE have been implemented and there is sufficient evidence that the intent of the PE is being met. However, opportunities for improvement may still remain.
• Partially meets: Systems and/or practices related to meeting the intent of the PE have been only partially implemented. There are gaps that may contribute to an inability to meet the intended outcome of the PE, or insufficient evidence can be provided to demonstrate that the activity is aligned to the intent of the PE.
• Does not meet: Systems and/or practices required to support the core intent of the PE are not in place, are not being implemented or cannot be evidenced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
