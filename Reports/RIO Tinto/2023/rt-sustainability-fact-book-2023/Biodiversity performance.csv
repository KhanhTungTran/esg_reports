,BIODIVERSITY PERFORMANCE,,,,,,,,
,"We are dependent on healthy ecosystems to run a successful business and we recognise our responsibility to effectively mitigate the impact of our operations on nature. Healthy natural environments with functioning ecosystems are key to climate resilience. They also provide important services to the communities where we operate and our business. We are committed to protecting biodiversity, and our ambition is to achieve no net loss where we operate. This means striking a balance between negative impacts on biodiversity and positive outcomes achieved through mitigation. We are active members of the ICMM and other industry associations and working groups seeking to drive improvements for our industry. Our involvement in the ICMM Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) working group, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Biodiversity Technical Committee and the ICMM Nature Working Group have contributed to the development of important industry resources: the TNFD framework, the draft GRI Biodiversity Standard, and ICMMâ€™s Nature Position Statement.

In 2023, we continued the independent review of monitoring programs at our high-priority biodiversity sites. This involved ensuring management plans and actions adequately address biodiversity risks. We completed this review at our Richards Bay Minerals site in 2023, with further efforts planned for 2024. We also submitted a revised Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for our planned mine and rail activities at our Simandou project in Guinea, drawing on data collected over the last decade, and have progressed work to deliver an ESIA in 2024 for the planned development of the port.

,"Important biodiversity features are defined as species, assemblages or habitats identified by stakeholders as important for their value in the structure and function of biodiversity, or their role in ensuring natural resource provision to local communities. All critical habitats are important biodiversity features.",,,,,,,,
,Monitoring plan refers to the monitoring of biodiversity to understand and manage potential impacts from Rio Tinto's activities in accordance with the requirements of the E16 standard and associated guidance.,,,,,,,,
,Offsets are defined as land set aside and considered as an offset either through regulatory or financier requirements (eg IFC).,,,,,,,,
,Independent review is a review completed by a non-Rio Tinto  subject matter expert that is considered independent to the asset.,,,,,,,,
,Biodiversity program reviews are required at a five-yearly frequency (minimum) or triggered by a significant change in biodiversity risk.,,,,,,,,
