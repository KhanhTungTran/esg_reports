More information can be provided in your answer to Q20.",Refer to Annex 2 of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management for classification categories and criteria.,,"(Yes or No) We note that this will depend on factors including local legislation that are not necessarily tied to best practice. As such, and because remedial action may have been taken, a “Yes” answer may not indicate heightened risk.
Stability concerns might include toe seepage, dam movement, overtopping, spillway failure, piping, etc. If yes, have appropriately designed and reviewed mitigation actions been implemented?
We also note that this question does not bear upon the appropriateness of the criteria, but rather the stewardship levels of the facility or the dam.

,"Rio Tinto interpretation 
and guidance","Rio Tinto's tailings facilities may have none, one or several dam structures. In order to provide a complete list of our tailings facilities, we have provided information by tailings facility rather than by dam. This is in alignment with guidance provided by ICMM to its company members on the completion of this response.
Rio Tinto is implementing the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) for all tailings  facilities where Rio Tinto is the Operator (as defined in the GISTM). This document includes details for these tailings facilities.",,,"Independent Operation is used where Rio Tinto holds a majority interest and tailings facilities are generally managed according to Rio Tinto standards, although Rio Tinto is not appointed as operator.",,,,"Our response to this question is aligned with the guidance provided by ICMM:
- Active: Receiving tailings as of August 2023.
- Inactive: Not receiving tailings as of August 2023.
- Closed: All construction activities as per the approved closure plan have been completed or are in the process of being closed.
",,"Rio Tinto's global Standard requires the Design Engineer / Engineer of Record to provide written verification that the facility is constructed and operated as per the design intent.
The exact design may change during construction due to field conditions, where approved by the Design Engineer. In this case. verification continues to be provided that the facility is operated in accordance with the design intent. This question has therefore been answered based on the requirements of the Rio Tinto standard.
The answers are also aligned with the following guidance provided by the ICMM:
- ""Approved"" means approved by the regulator if there is such a regulator in the jurisdiction that provides an approval.
- If there is no regulator that provides an approval, “approved” means approved by the Design Engineer / Engineer of Record for the facility.","Our response to this question is aligned with the guidance provided by the ICMM:
- Construction method for the last raise is stated.
- In the case of multiple dams for one tailings facility, this reports on the largest/highest consequence one.","The heights reported here are the current height at the maximum height section, not the final design height. In the case of multiple dams for one tailings facility, the height of the highest one has been provided.",,"Volumes provided are the planned total volume of tailings that will be contained within the tailings facility in 5 years time, not the incremental volume change. This is based on current production plans, which may change with time.","The Rio Tinto global Standard for the management of tailings and water storage facilities mandates that both design and operational reviews are carried out by an independent specialist or an independent review team for all tailings and water storage facilities. Both independent design reviews and independent operational reviews are considered relevant to this question, and so the date of the most recent of either type of review is provided.","For some of our older tailings facilities that were constructed, operated and/or closed prior to the requirement to complete or retain these records, or that have become part of the Rio Tinto Group through acquisitions post-construction, we may not have a full documentation history for the facilities. Additional investigation and analysis may have been carried out to understand the construction and performance of these structures.
Where we do not have all records, we have followed the guidance provided and assessed whether or not we have ""all necessary documents to make an informed and substantiated decision on the safety of the dam"", and have answered the question on this basis.","All facilities have been given a consequence classification in accordance with Annex 2 of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM).
Consequence classifications are not a judgement on the condition of a facility or the likelihood of failure but on the potential consequence if there was to be a failure.","Rio Tinto is implementing the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) for all tailings facilities  where Rio Tinto is the Operator (as defined in the GISTM).
The GISTM specifies a consequence classification scheme based on consequence categories and assessment appraches that may differ from previously used classification schemes. As a result the hazard categorisation for a tailings facility may change when the GISTM consequence classification is used.","Our response to this question is aligned with the guidance provided by the ICMM:
- Are there any potential latent life-safety concerns with an existing facility that have been previously flagged but remain unaddressed?
- For operating facilities, this refers to any identified deficiency for the current life/stage. For a previous life/stage, any deficiency that was not addressed as vetted by independent review.
- For closed/legacy facilities, this refers to any deficiency identified that reflects the current state of the facility versus a previous issue that has been addressed through confirmed changed condition via the closure process.","Rio Tinto has tailings specialists employed across the Rio Tinto Product Groups, at individual operations and in centralised technical support hubs. In addition, Rio Tinto's Surface Mining Centre of Excellence team includes tailings specialists who provide technical governance, review, leadership and stewardship for the tailings facilities across the Rio Tinto Group.",,"The Rio Tinto global Standard for the management of tailings and water storage facilities mandates that closure is incorporated in the design of a tailings facility and that a closure plan is in place for each tailings facility.
Closure plans include monitoring, where required, to meet closure objectives.
Our response to this question is also aligned with the guidance provided by the ICMM:
- This could be a conceptual or complete closure plan.","The ability for a tailings facility to handle significant weather events is considered in the tailings facility design process, and this is reviewed in any additional design work carried out for a tailings facility. As a result, Rio Tinto's tailings facilities are designed with freeboard to accommodate anticipated extreme weather events based on current weather projections.
External research is ongoing into how the impacts of climate change should be factored in to the design, operation and closure of tailings facilities. When there is industry consensus on the best approach Rio Tinto will reassess the impact of climate change on our tailings facilities, where this assessment has not yet been carried out.",,,

Content of document

This document includes figures, classifications, assessments and other information regarding tailings and Rio Tinto’s systems. Some of the information provided relies upon judgement based on internal or external reviews of information. Unless otherwise stated the information in the document is based on data available as at 5 August 2023, and judgements or assessments in the document may be based on data which predates 5 August 2023. The information and views may change based on new or different information, circumstances or events and should not be relied upon as a forecast or recommendation.  

Rio Tinto is implementing the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) for all tailings facilities where Rio Tinto is the Operator (as defined in GISTM). For each of our tailings facilities with ""Very High"" and ""Extreme"" GISTM consequence classifications, we have published on the Rio Tinto website a Tailings Facility Disclosure under Principle 15 of the GISTM that provides information on implementation status and summaries of our tailings management processes. 

Non-operated sites with tailings facilities in which Rio Tinto has an interest include: Alumar, Blackbird, Escondida, Gladstone Power Station, Mineração Río do Norte, Olette, Ranger and Saint Cyr.



Forward looking statements

The information presented contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, operations and businesses of Rio Tinto. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance of, or events affecting Rio Tinto, or the industry, to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Such forward-looking statements involve subjective judgements and determinations based on available geological, technical, contractual and economic information. These could change because of new information from production or mining activities, or changes in economic factors, including changes in market prices and operating costs, changes in the regulatory policies of host governments, or other events. The statements could also be altered by acquisitions and divestments, new discoveries, and extensions or closure of existing mines, as well as the application of improved recovery and tailings techniques. Published statements could also be subject to correction due to errors in the application of internal assurance or published rules or guidance, and changes in that assurance, rules or guidance. Please also refer to further factors and risks as identified in Rio Tinto’s most recent Annual Report in Australia and the United Kingdom and the most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or Forms 6-K furnished to, or filed with, the SEC.

As such, readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, including with regard to future investment decisions. 

Rio Tinto undertakes no obligation to publicly update, or revise, any information in the document, including forward-looking statements, as a result of new information, future events or other information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
