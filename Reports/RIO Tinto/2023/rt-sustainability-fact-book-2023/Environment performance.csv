,ENVIRONMENT,,,,,,
,"As environmental stewards, we focus on responsibly managing shared resources to protect the health, safety and livelihoods of local communities. We manage risk to minimise adverse environmental impacts from our operations and to sustain our shared ecosystems, planet and natural resources for future generations. 

In 2023, we continued the independent review of monitoring programs at our high-priority biodiversity sites. This involved ensuring management plans and actions adequately address biodiversity risks. We completed this review at our Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) site in 2023, with further efforts planned for 2024. Also in 2023, we rehabilitated 22 square kilometres of land, mostly at our iron ore mines and exploration areas in the Pilbara, Western Australia and our mineral sands mines in South Africa and Madagascar. Of this, we rehabilitated 4.5 square kilometres of ex-pit landforms and legacy areas across our Pilbara mines. This is part of our Iron Ore business’s plan to increase rehabilitation, in partnership with Pilbara Aboriginal businesses. Since 2021, we have completed 24 square kilometres of land rehabilitation across our Pilbara mine operations. In Mongolia, we have rehabilitated 4 square kilometres of abandoned mine workings based outside our operational footprint, along valley floors and river beds in the Selenge province. This is a part of Oyu Tolgoi’s commitment to the Government of Mongolia’s national movement to plant one billion trees by 2030.",,,,,,

,"Significant environmental incident is an incident with an actual consequence rating of high or very high. We measure and rate incidents according to their actual environmental and compliance impacts using five severity categories: very low, low, moderate, high and very high. Very high and high environmental incidents are usually reported to the relevant product group head and the Rio Tinto Chief Executive as soon as possible. The severity categories were updated for incident reporting in 2023 based on changes to Rio Tinto's risk matrix and associated environment consequence descriptors.",,,,,,
