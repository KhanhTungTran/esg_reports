3,,SAFETY,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"Although there were no fatalities on our managed sites in 2023, in January 2024, tragically four team members from our Diavik mine in Canada lost their lives when a charter flight crashed on its way to the mine. In 2023, we also continued to see fatalities more broadly across our industry, including six at our non-managed operations. We firmly believe all fatalities are preventable. Our focus remains on identifying, managing and, where possible, eliminating risks to ensure everyone, including partners and colleagues at our non-managed operations, goes home safely every day. Our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) was 0.37 in 2023, an improvement from 2022 (2022: 0.40). We continue to see a disparity in safety performance for employees compared to contractors, so our focus remains on improving contractor safety by further integrating contractors into our safety culture.\n\nCritical risk management (CRM) remains our primary fatality elimination tool, helping to ensure critical controls are in place and working where there is a fatal risk. In 2023, we initiated a project to help our teams reconnect with why we have CRM, and to enhance the quality of verifications which check that the right critical controls are in place for each task. In 2023, we introduced a program to help our teams learn critical lessons related to vehicles and driving, including potential gaps in vehicles and driving critical controls, andÃÂ developing effective strategies to addressÃÂ these. We also focused on deepening our understanding of mass transport risks, facilitating self-assessments at our sites to identify compliance with our Group procedure. We will undertake a similar exercise to better understand our aviation-related risk profile in 2024.",,,,,,,,,,,

15,,"Introduced in 2019, the SMM provides a roadmap to improving safety and enabling comparable evaluation and learning across the organisation. The model has four categories:\t\n - leadership and engagement \n - risk management (including CRM) \n - work planning and execution and \n - learning and improvement. \n\nThe model is assessed across levels of maturity with a scale of 1-9: Basic (1-3), Evolving (4-6) and Advanced (7-9). \n\nIn 2022, a series of enhancements were made to the SMM and the assessment approach along with reset of the Group score based upon these enhancements. In 2023, 49 operations were assessed against the model with over 7,000 people engaged. While the enhancements in 2022 significantly raised the bar, the overall Group SMM score increased to 5.2, signifying an 11% increase compared to 2022.\n\nFigures in the table represent the Group average SMM score at the end of each year. Each year, assets are added or removed from the SMM program based on Project and Closure cycles. New assets to the program are baselined in the first quarter of each year and added to the Group average at the end of the year.",,,,,,,,,,,
