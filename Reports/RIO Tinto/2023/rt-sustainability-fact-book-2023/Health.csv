,"Caring for one another is one of our values – it is part of who we are and the way we work, every shift, every day. Nothing is more important than the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and communities.

In 2023, we recorded a higher number of new occupational health illnesses compared to the previous year, with 98 (2022: 70), in line with our increased focus on medical assessments. These assessments are a key requirement in ensuring and maintaining our employees’ fitness for work, addressing legislative requirements and managing risk profiles. We continue to standardise and simplify these assessments to help improve our health performance. We also ran two workshops for our global health and hygiene practitioners to share learnings, best practice and recent technology developments in the Southern and Northern hemispheres. We completed occupational and industrial hygiene monitoring at all of our operational and managed assets.",,,,,,,
