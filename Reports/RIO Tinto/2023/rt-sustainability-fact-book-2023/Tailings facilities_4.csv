Some of the information provided relies upon judgement based on internal or external reviews of information. Unless otherwise stated the information in the document is based on data available as at 5 August 2023, and judgements or assessments in the document may be based on data which predates 5 August 2023. The information and views may change based on new or different information, circumstances or events and should not be relied upon as a forecast or recommendation. \n\nRio Tinto is implementing the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) for all tailings facilities where Rio Tinto is the Operator (as defined in GISTM). For each of our tailings facilities with ""Very High"" and ""Extreme"" GISTM consequence classifications, we have published on the Rio Tinto website a Tailings Facility Disclosure under Principle 15 of the GISTM that provides information on implementation status and summaries of our tailings management processes. \n\nNon-operated sites with tailings facilities in which Rio Tinto has an interest include: Alumar, Blackbird, Escondida, Gladstone Power Station, MineraÃÂ§ÃÂ£o RÃÂ­o do Norte, Olette, Ranger and Saint Cyr.\n\n\n\nForward looking statements\n\nThe information presented contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, operations and businesses of Rio Tinto. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. \nForward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on managementÃ¢ÂÂs current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance of, or events affecting Rio Tinto, or the industry, to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Such forward-looking statements involve subjective judgements and determinations based on available geological, technical, contractual and economic information. These could change because of new information from production or mining activities, or changes in economic factors, including changes in market prices and operating costs, changes in the regulatory policies of host governments, or other events. The statements could also be altered by acquisitions and divestments, new discoveries, and extensions or closure of existing mines, as well as the application of improved recovery and tailings techniques. Published statements could also be subject to correction due to errors in the application of internal assurance or published rules or guidance, and changes in that assurance, rules or guidance. Please also refer to further factors and risks as identified in Rio TintoÃ¢ÂÂs most recent Annual Report in Australia and the United Kingdom and the most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢ÂÂSECÃ¢ÂÂ) or Forms 6-K furnished to, or filed with, the SEC.\n\nAs such, readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, including with regard to future investment decisions. \n\nRio Tinto undertakes no obligation to publicly update, or revise, any information in the document, including forward-looking statements, as a result of new information, future events or other information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
