It is a mixture of market and location based methods. The data is on an equity basis and includes electricity generated and sold to third parties.",,,,,
41,,"1. ""Renewable electricity purchased (with contracted energy attributes)"" is where we report zero Scope 2 emissions for the equivalent electricity purchased (in MWh). Under these circumstances, the renewable supply may or may not be connected to the site and follows the reporting energy market rules of the country or region.",,,,,
42,,"2. Rio Tinto has entered into electricity supply contracts for operations with low emission or renewable electricity suppliers, in many cases before market-based reporting and renewable energy certificates existed from these suppliers. The 'renewable electricity purchased (without contracted energy attributes)' is indicative of the physical location of sites in relation to large renewable energy suppliers we are contracted to on physical supply including ISAL in Iceland, NZAS in New Zealand and Bell Bay in Tasmania, Australia. Under a market-based Scope 2 method these are not treated as zero emission sources and these are grid connected and not classified as direct supply.",,,,,
