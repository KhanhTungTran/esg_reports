83,,"Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) is 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20% owned by Rusal. However, as a result of QAL's activation of a step-in process following the Australian GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs sanction measures, Rio Tinto is currently entitled to utilise 100% of the capacity at QAL, but paying 100% of the costs for as long as that step-in continues. Our 2023 equity emissions and our 2018 baseline include QAL emissions on the basis of Rio TintoÃ¢ÂÂs 80% ownership. In 2023, the additional emissions associated with the step-in were 0.8Mt. Rusal has commenced proceedings challenging the validity of the step-in and the sanctions regime may change over time, such that the duration of the step-in remains uncertain. Historical Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been restated to reflect improvements in data quality.",,,,,,,,,,,

Scope 2: market-based emissions reported as zero include Escondida, Resolution Copper, Weipa and Kennecott Copper with surrendered Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and Oyu Tolgoi I-RECs from Inner Mongolia and nearby provinces.

Our net emissions total does not include 86,000 ACCUs retired for compliance with the Safeguard Mechanism for the period 2021-22. We expect to include ACCUs in our net emissions figure from 2024 onwards.",,,,,,,,,,,
