,"Further notes on production and capacity
Mined copper: On track for 1Mt copper production within five years.
Recycled aluminium (Matalco): System capacity of 900kt; production of 582kt in 2023.
Lithium carbonate (Rincon 3000): System capacity of 3,000 tonnes by the end of 2024.
Iron ore (Pilbara System): System capacity of 345-360Mt mid-term.
Iron ore dual fines product of blast furnace and direct reduction fines (Simandou): 60Mtpa production target (Rio Tinto share of 27Mt). The estimated annualised capacity of approximately 60 million dry tonnes per annum iron ore for the Simandou life of mine schedule was previously reported in a release to the ASX dated 6 December 2023 titled “Investor Seminar 2023”. Rio Tinto confirms that all material assumptions underpinning that production target continue to apply and have not materially changed.

	1.Production figures are measured according to Rio Tinto's ownership % share of each site. For further details on the share %, see pages 297 and 298 of the Annual Report where these have been highlighted.
	2.Revenue reflects third party sales by product on a consolidated basis inclusive of our share of equity accounted units. 
	3.Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and other intangible assets, inclusive of our share of equity accounted units and reported by product.
	4.Operating assets by product recorded above are the net assets of subsidiaries, joint operations and the Group’s share relating to equity accounted units adjusted for net (debt)/cash and post-retirement assets and liabilities, net of tax, after the deduction of non-controlling interests.
	5.Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions are measured on an equity basis and align to the Rio Tinto ownership % share used to record production values. For additional information on our emissions methodology, see our 2023 Sustainability Fact Book at riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting.
	6.The emissions in this table are Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the operating sites producing the commodity listed. The total differs from the full Group share reported numbers as these exclude development, closure sites, marine and corporate emissions.
	7.Copper production from Oyu Tolgoi, Kennecott and Escondida has been certified under the Copper Mark system. The Copper Mark certification for Escondida has been obtained via BHP who is the majority partner.
	8.For a list of assets certified under the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative, see our 2023 Sustainability Fact Book.
	9.Minerals comprise titanium dioxide slag (KTM), borates (TNM), salt (TNM) and diamonds (TNM).
	10.2023 Mineral production is as follows:
	•Titanium dioxide slag (‘000 tonnes): 1,111 (2022: 1,200)
	•Borates (‘000 tonnes): 495 (2022: 532)
	•Salt (‘000 tonnes): 5,973 (2022: 5,757)
	•Diamonds (‘000 carats): 3,340 (2022: 4,651)
	11.Iron Ore Company of Canada continues to be reported at Rio Tinto share.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
