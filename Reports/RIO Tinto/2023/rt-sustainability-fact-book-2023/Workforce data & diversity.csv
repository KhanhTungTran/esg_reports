,"We are finding better waysTM to live our values and build an environment of trust where everyone feels safe, respected and empowered. This is how we attract and retain world-class talent to our operations globally. More than 39,000 employees responded to our most recent survey in October 2023, and our employee satisfaction score (eSAT) increased to 74 (from 73 in 2022). Of particular note was the positive progress we are making on key indicators aligned with everyday respect: authenticity (75), belonging (71), inclusion (69) and speaking up (74). We have more to do and will continue to focus on accountability and increasing collaboration inside and outside of our business. 

In 2023, we continued our work to support an inclusive culture by implementing the recommendations outlined in the Everyday Respect Report. Our focus has been on:  
   - promoting respect
   - investing in leadership development
   - creating an inclusive workplace
   - increasing support for our people
   - ensuring equality through pay equity.
