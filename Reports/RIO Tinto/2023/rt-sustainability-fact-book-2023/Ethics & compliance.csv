,"In early 2023, we launched The Way We Work, our updated Code of Conduct, which is available on our website, riotinto.com. It is designed to help all employees and contractors live our values of care, courage and curiosity, and is a central tool in reshaping our culture. The values, commitments and behaviours set out in our Code of Conduct provide clarity which allows us to deliver responsibly. It is broader in scope than the previous version, reflecting changes in societal expectations. It also includes our newly developed ethical decision-making model to help our people reflect on the potential impacts decisions may have on the business and others. An interactive, online version of the Code of Conduct is also available, including additional related content, real life examples and associated training.
 
Our reputation as a business that operates with high levels of integrity is dependent on the actions and decisions we make each day. We empower our people to seek guidance when faced with ethical or business dilemmas – both to prevent incidents from occurring, and to protect them and others from harm. To help equip our workforce to navigate uncertain areas and spot ethical and compliance-related risks, we implemented a new online training course focused on ethical decision making through several interactive, real-life scenarios.  We had 25,187 employees completing online training in 2023.  In addition to online training, the Ethics and Compliance team delivers tailored risk-based face-to-face training on anti-bribery and corruption, data privacy, anti-trust and trade sanctions. A total of 6,359 employees received face-to-face training in 2023.  We also provide business integrity training to our third parties on a risk basis. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
