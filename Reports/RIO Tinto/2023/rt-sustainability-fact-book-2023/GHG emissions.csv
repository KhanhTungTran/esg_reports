,"Our operational emissions targets are ambitious - to reduce emissions by 15% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 relative to 2018 levels, reaching net zero by 2050. Our targets cover more than 95% of our reported Scope 1 and 2 emissions and are aligned with 1.5°C pathways.  We adjust our baseline to exclude reductions achieved by divesting assets and to account for acquisitions. 

Our definition of net zero applies to our operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions on an equity basis. To reach net zero we will need to decarbonise our operations as far as technically and commercially practical, and address all the remaining emissions with carbon dioxide removals from the atmosphere and long-term storage. To tackle our Scope 3 emissions across our value chains we are committed to helping our  customers and suppliers achieve their targets a decade earlier - reaching net zero by 2050. In particular, we continue to work with our customers to develop and scale up the technologies to decarbonise steel and aluminium production. ",,,,,,,,,,,

Changes to our 2018 baseline include: Scope 2 update to market-based methodology, the additional equity share of the Oyu Tolgoi mine that was purchased in mid-December 2022, and the additional equity share of MRN purchased in 2024.
The baseline value is based on the current equity in each asset, including zero equity in divested assets.",,,,,,,,,,,

,"Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) is 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20% owned by Rusal. However, as a result of QAL's activation of a step-in process following the Australian Government’s sanction measures, Rio Tinto is currently entitled to utilise 100% of the capacity at QAL, but paying 100% of the costs for as long as that step-in continues. Our 2023 equity emissions and our 2018 baseline include QAL emissions on the basis of Rio Tinto’s 80% ownership. In 2023, the additional emissions associated with the step-in were 0.8Mt.
