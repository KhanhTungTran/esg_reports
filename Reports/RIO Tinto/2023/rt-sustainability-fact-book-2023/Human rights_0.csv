4,,"Our human rights program is core to delivering on our business strategy and achieving impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials. By respecting and upholding human rights, we will be an attractive and trusted partner to our stakeholders. We continue to evolve our human rights performance to help prevent our involvement in adverse human rights impacts. We regularly review and update internal standards, systems and processes to integrate human rights due diligence and promote more responsible and ethical ways of working.\nAs part of ongoing assurance of our human rights program, the Group Internal Audit team completed its review of risk assessment and evaluation processes across the GroupÃ¢ÂÂs identified salient issues. The review found that while risks impacting human rights are being identified and captured in risk management systems, broader Group-wide understanding of risks and human rights consequences is needed. To help with this, we continue to develop our Group-wide human rights controls, with a focus on modern slavery risk control management. In 2023, our human rights team delivered 35 tailored training sessions targeting 11 assets and 12 functional teams globally. We recorded 2,441 completions of our modern slavery online learning module.",
