,"In 2023, we have spent time developing, testing and launching new leadership programs that will help our leaders create a safe environment, empower their teams and perform together. 
We are also committed to increasing cultural knowledge, advancing Indigenous leadership in our workforce and creating an environment where everyone feels safe and respected. In Australia, our Indigenous leadership program continues to fast-track Indigenous Australians into professional and leadership roles, helping us to ensure that we have a stronger representation of diverse voices across our business. 

Ensuring that employees with similar skills, knowledge, qualifications, experience and performance are paid equally for the same or comparable work is intrinsically linked to our commitment to inclusion and diversity. We remain committed to eliminating any residual pay inequities based on gender or other non-legitimate dimensions of difference. 
Our equal pay gap, the primary lens we use when assessing gender pay, measures the extent to which women and men employed by our company in the same location and performing work of equal value receive the same pay. Our 2023 equal pay gap is 1% in favour of men. Our gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between the average earnings of women and men across the Group (excluding incentive pay), regardless of role, expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings. Our 2023 gender pay gap is 1% in favour of women. ",,,,,
