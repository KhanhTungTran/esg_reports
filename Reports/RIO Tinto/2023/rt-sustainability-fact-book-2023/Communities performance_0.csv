4,,"We have evolved our approach to engaging with communities and Indigenous Peoples across our business. By listening to understand, being willing to learn from our mistakes and genuine partnering, we will deliver better long-term outcomes for everyone. It enhances our understanding and appreciation of the people and diverse cultures in the geographies where we work. Our relationships with Indigenous Peoples are a priority for us and we especially value our agreements with First Nations People of the lands on which we operate. \n\nOur Communities and Social Performance (CSP) teams work across our entire business and include people with a range of expertise, from archaeologists, anthropologists, social scientists and economic development experts, to human rights specialists and operational leaders. While these teams help to implement our technical activities, everyone in our business has a role to play in our social licence. In 2023, we progressed initiatives towards our 2026 CSP targets. We focused on developing and implementing frameworks and measurement criteria for both cultural heritage co-management and social investment strategic partnerships. Our human rights training continued throughout the year, with planning for expanded online learning programs.",,,,,,

28,,"1. Rio Tinto takes a ""site-centric"" view of the definition of ""local"" which allows operations to establish their own definition, based on a set of common principles. These principles require that each operation, in defining ""local"" takes into consideration its geographic, social and economic area of impact as well as ownership. For example, suppliers located within the Pilbara Region of Western Australia are defined as ""local"" for Rio Tinto Iron Ore's Pilbara Operations. This approach is consistent with international best practice and aligns with the ICMM Social and Economic Reporting Framework guidance.",,,,,,
