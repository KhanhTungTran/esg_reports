3,,WATER PERFORMANCE,,,,,
4,,"Water is a shared resource critical to sustaining biodiversity, people and economic prosperity. Increasingly disrupted weather patterns and more extreme weather events due to climate change, and a growing world population, mean efficiently managing water is more important than ever. The way we think about water and manage associated risks reflects the diversity of our operations and geographic locations. A small proportion of our assets operate in water-scarce regions, while others must remove excess water to allow safe mining operations. These are examples of the many potential risks we manage across the life cycle of our diverse operations.\n\nOur total operational withdrawals for 2023 were 1,170GL (2022: 1,173GL). Freshwater, or category 1 quality, withdrawals accounted for 424GL or 36% of this total (2022: 432GL). Freshwater is generally suitable for consumption with minimal treatment required. Where possible, we aim to minimise our extractions from water sources of this quality.\nTotal discharges for 2023 were 692GL (2022: 694GL). Total water recycled or reused for 2023 was 303GL (2022: 312GL).",,,,,
