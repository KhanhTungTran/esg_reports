5,,"As a founding member of the ICMM, Rio Tinto has committed to completing our implementation of the ICMM Performance Expectations (PEs). The ICMM Mining Principles framework focuses on implementation of systems and practices related to a broad range of sustainability areas. In line with ICMM requirements, all 29 Rio Tinto-managed operating and refining assets completed an ICMM PE self-assessment before 30 September 2022. A self-assessment was also completed for Rio Tinto Corporate. \n\nIn 2022, Rio Tinto prioritised 26 of the 29 operating assets for validation in the initial three-year cycle based on the following criteria:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Integrated assurance schedule: Rio Tinto is taking an integrated approach to the ESG assurance program, which will commence in 2023. Integrated assurance refers to an asset completing one assurance activity to respond to multiple different frameworks. The integrated assurance schedule aligns all of Rio TintoÃ¢ÂÂs ESG certifications and membership commitments such that they will be conducted as an integrated assurance activity over a three-year assurance cycle.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Operating/refining assets risk and size considerations: The three assets that will not be prioritised in this initial three-year validation cycle include Wilmington; Coudekerque and Suzhou. They were not prioritised for this validation cycle due to the nature of the operations and as many of the PEs were self-assessed and calibrated by an experienced Validation Service Provider (VSP), ERM Canada as Ã¢ÂÂNot ApplicableÃ¢ÂÂ. In addition, all three operations have a workforce below 100 full-time equivalents.\n\nIn 2023, on-site third-party validations were completed for 12 of our priority operating and refining assets and included validation of the Rio Tinto corporate self-assessment. As of 9 February 2024, we have received validation reports for three sites; Oyu Tolgoi (OT), Rio Tinto Kennecott (RTK) and Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC). The remaining nine sites were assessed in late 2023 and the final reports are still pending. The validation outcomes for these sites will be disclosed in the 2024 Sustainability Fact Book. The validation reports received to date indicate alignment between the self-assessment and validation outcomes, with identification of relevant areas for improvement. \n\nThe results presented in the table below reflect the most recent self-assessments. For sites that have completed third-party validation and received their final reports, the results presented in the table below reflect the validated outcomes.\n\nThe possible outcomes for the validation of an individual PE are Ã¢ÂÂMeetsÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂPartially meetsÃ¢ÂÂ, and Ã¢ÂÂDoes not meetÃ¢ÂÂ as defined below:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Meets: Systems and/or practices related to the PE have been implemented and there is sufficient evidence that the intent of the PE is being met. However, opportunities for improvement may still remain.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Partially meets: Systems and/or practices related to meeting the intent of the PE have been only partially implemented. There are gaps that may contribute to an inability to meet the intended outcome of the PE, or insufficient evidence can be provided to demonstrate that the activity is aligned to the intent of the PE.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Does not meet: Systems and/or practices required to support the core intent of the PE are not in place, are not being implemented or cannot be evidenced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are working towards delivery of no net loss for biodiversity and utilise the biodiversity mitigation hierarchy to drive progress towards this goal. \nIn support of efforts to implement No Net Loss, we have engaged in working groups to pilot and provide feedback on the Task Force for Nature-related Financial Disclosures, the development of the GRI Biodiversity Standard and the ICMM Nature Position Statement, which provide a framework and reporting expectations to see delivery of No Net Loss at our assets. Support to develop sector specific measurement methods and metrics, to inform a standardised delivery approach is ongoing. Internally, efforts are underway to integrate these recommendations and requirements into our current operating, risk, impact, and governance framework.\n\nAdditional improvement opportunities were identified by some assets, including updating fauna assessments for listed species.\n\nWilmington, Coudekerque and Suzhou assessed as ""not applicable"" as they are located in industrial areas and no sensitive or recognized biodiversity or ecosystems services have or are expected to be identified.\n\nOT has an established biodiversity management plan that includes offsets to achieve no net loss. OT has been assessed as ""partially meets"" in the validation report until offset plans are updated to reflect the mine footprint expansion."
