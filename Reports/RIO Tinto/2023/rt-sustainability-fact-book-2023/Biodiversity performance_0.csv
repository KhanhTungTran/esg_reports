4,,"We are dependent on healthy ecosystems to run a successful business and we recognise our responsibility to effectively mitigate the impact of our operations on nature. Healthy natural environments with functioning ecosystems are key to climate resilience. They also provide important services to the communities where we operate and our business. We are committed to protecting biodiversity, and our ambition is to achieve no net loss where we operate. This means striking a balance between negative impacts on biodiversity and positive outcomes achieved through mitigation. We are active members of the ICMM and other industry associations and working groups seeking to drive improvements for our industry. Our involvement in the ICMM Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) working group, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Biodiversity Technical Committee and the ICMM Nature Working Group have contributed to the development of important industry resources: the TNFD framework, the draft GRI Biodiversity Standard, and ICMMÃ¢ÂÂs Nature Position Statement.\n\nIn 2023, we continued the independent review of monitoring programs at our high-priority biodiversity sites. This involved ensuring management plans and actions adequately address biodiversity risks. We completed this review at our Richards Bay Minerals site in 2023, with further efforts planned for 2024. We also submitted a revised Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for our planned mine and rail activities at our Simandou project in Guinea, drawing on data collected over the last decade, and have progressed work to deliver an ESIA in 2024 for the planned development of the port.",,,,,,,,
