168,,"2 - In FY23, we reviewed and evolved the methodology and data collection for category 15. Consequently, adjustments have been introduced to rectify instances of double counting entities already addressed within other scopes and categories of our emissions reporting. These refinements provided greater consistency between the approach taken to calculate our historical emissions and current year reporting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
169,,"3 - In FY23, we identified that the emissions associated with joint ventures and associated investments were not being captured in our reporting of category 15. We have rectified this in FY23 and made adjustments to the historical figures to ensure the data is complete, accurate and comparable from our FY19 baseline year onwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
