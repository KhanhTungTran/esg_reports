,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Notes: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"1 - The Digicel Pacific acquisition (which closed in FY23) has been excluded from Telstra’s targets, climate change and circular economy data in FY23 given the challenges in compiling timely and quality environment data that aligns to the GHG Protocol. A detailed program of work has been launched to align environment data processes and controls with the aim to quantitatively disclose the Digicel Pacific impact in our FY24 reporting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"1 – For rationale around inclusion and exclusion of categories and calculation methodology, please see the scope 3 emissions methodology table below.					",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"2 -  In FY23, we reviewed and evolved the methodology and data collection for category 15. Consequently, adjustments have been introduced to rectify instances of double counting entities already addressed within other scopes and categories of our emissions reporting. These refinements provided greater consistency between the approach taken to calculate our historical emissions and current year reporting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"3 - In FY23, we identified that the emissions associated with joint ventures and associated investments were not being captured in our reporting of category 15. We have rectified this in FY23 and made adjustments to the historical figures to ensure the data is complete, accurate and comparable from our FY19 baseline year onwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
