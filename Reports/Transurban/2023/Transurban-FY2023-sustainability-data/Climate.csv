,"As part of our response to TCFD, we use climate-related metrics and targets (also refer to Environment tab) to provide transparency on what we monitor and the progress we are making towards mitigating climate change-related impacts and risks. Other sustainability and environmental metrics (such as water use, waste diversion from landfill) are referenced in the Environmental pages of this Sustainability data pack. As we continue to progress against our Climate Change Framework and our approach to climate change and transition planning evolves, we will continue to review and enhance our current set of performance metrics in line with TCFD guidance, and the emerging IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, S1 and S2. 

The following information is forward looking and is provided to assist stakeholders in understanding our strategic resilience to a range of climate-related scenarios. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes. These forward looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and opportunities, which gives rise to the possibility that our strategic resilience conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that our assumptions may not be correct, and that our resilience conclusions may not be achieved. We caution readers to not place undue reliance on these statements as a number of risk factors may cause our actual resilience to differ materially from the conclusions expressed in such forward-looking statements.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,"1 Captured via Transurban's HSE reporting system. Heat-related injuries have remained low in the past few years. With increasing temperatures, this will be monitored closely to capture the HSE impacts of extreme temperatures
2 This data has been restated due to improvements in methodology. Incident numbers based on reported traffic incidents (including incidents logged as crash, incident, secondary incident, broken down vehicle) on our assets in Australia where this data is available. Correlation has occurred with BOM weather data to include 10mm of rain within 1 hour from the nearest metro weather station (<=5km), or days where temperature has reached over 40 degrees Celsius. Note - North American assets excluded from reporting as not available in our system data at this time.
3 Based on major projects which have had climate risk assessed independently or through our assets, including West Gate Tunnel Project, Fredericksburg Extension and 495 Express Lanes Northern Extension. Note M7-M12 Integration is a new project with limited activity during the reporting period. A climate risk assessment will be completed during project delivery.
4 Based on 14 of 22 assets having CCAPs in place. Number includes M7 (CCAP pending).
5 Transurban “A” grading is for FY22 and within the “Leadership” band in the CDP reporting scheme
6 Average verified IS Rating score of all Australian projects to date, weighted by project capital cost. Design rating scores are replaced by As Built scores and may vary as each project moves through the two-phase IS Rating process. Infrastructure projects in North America are rated with Envision Sustainability framework and not included in this metric. Current major projects in North America are aiming for Silver to Platinum awards upon completion. 
7 To determine Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity, total revenue has been extracted from the profit and loss statement in corresponding years.
8 Scope 3 emissions include the impacts of our supply chain purchases, major project construction, as well as corporate Scope 3 emissions associated with fuel, electricity, waste and business travel. Scope 3 emissions are expected to fluctuate year-on-year mostly with variation in construction activities, which are our largest Scope 3 emissions source.
9 GHG savings and materials savings are from efficiencies in design and construction activity and the use of lower-embodied emission materials. Figures are based on Australian major project IS ratings, which measure reductions achieved from a ‘Base Case’ (initial design) through to ‘Actual Case’ (final project with sustainability initiatives implemented). Figures reported in each year are cumulative totals of all projects with completed ratings. Each project completes a ‘Design’ rating followed by an ‘As Built’ rating. Cumulative figures are updated to reflect the latest available rating for each project.",,,,,,,,,,,,
