7,,,Recommendations addressed,FY23 Management Response,,Where this is addressed in our Disclosure
8,,Governance,Disclose the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.\na)\t Describe the BoardÃ¢ÂÂs oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities \nb)\t Describe managementÃ¢ÂÂs role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities,"Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Climate-related risks covering both threats and opportunities are overseen by the Board of Directors via the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC). The ARC is updated at least twice each year on specific climate-related risks, emerging themes, and areas of progress.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Quarterly business risk reviews are undertaken, encompassing all material risks including relevant climate-related threats and opportunities.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ TCFD Implementation Guidance (released in October 2021) considered across governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets themes.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Our Sustainability team is responsible for the strategic response and overall direction of our climate-related risks, working in collaboration with our Risk and Compliance team. This work is overseen by members of our Executive Committee, including the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ The Customer, Community and Sustainability Council (CCSC) and Climate Change Governance Committee (CCGC) provide oversight on climate-related initiatives, management priorities, and our annual disclosure.",,"FY23 Corporate Report Page 39, Governance"
9,,Strategy,"Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.\na)\t Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organisation has identified over the short, medium, and long-term\nb)\t Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs businesses, strategy, and financial planning \nc)\t Describe the resilience of the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2ÃÂ°C or lower scenario","Ã¢ÂÂ¢\t The Climate Change Framework addresses the risks (threats and opportunities) associated with the transition to net zero, the physical impacts of climate change and sets our strategic direction and implementation plan across short, medium, and long-term time horizons. \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\tClimate change is considered as a broader strategic business risk. Climate-related risks have been identified and consolidated into four high-level strategic threats and two strategic opportunities. Materiality is determined by the potential long-term impacts, likelihood the risk will be realised, and relationship with our organisational strategy and financial systems. \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\t Transitional risks have been reviewed through three climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) at the corporate level to understand the possible short, medium, and longer-term impacts to our organisational strategy, major projects, and operational assets.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\t We have identified potential material climate-related financial impacts and commenced development of a methodology to measure the potential qualitative, or financial, impacts of climate-related risks. The first phase involves analysing the actual direct financial impacts of a recent acute weather event, the La Nina flood event in QLD, on two Brisbane assets (Gateway Motorway and AirportlinkM7).",,"FY23 Corporate Report, Page 40, Strategy"
10,,Risk Management,"Disclose how the organisation identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.\na)\t Describe the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks\nb)\t Describe the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs processes for managing climate-related risks\nc)\t Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organisationÃ¢ÂÂs overall risk management","Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Climate Risk and Adaptation Guideline has been developed to ensure a consistent and aligned approach when undertaking detailed investigations and to inform asset-specific Climate Change Adaptation Plans (CCAPs). The guideline aligns with TransurbanÃ¢ÂÂs Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework, and details how to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks, including those with the potential to have a material impact on the business. This includes how to escalate key risks appropriately for decision-making and to support proactive management.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Climate-related risks are regularly reviewed in accordance with our ERM Framework or as otherwise required (dependent on asset-specific CCAP outcomes, emerging TCFD guidance and frequency of evolving IPCC scientific findings).\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\t Asset-specific Climate Change Adaptation Plans (CCAPs) have been completed for six Queensland assets (AirportlinkM7, Clem7, Go Between Bridge, Legacy Way and the Gateway and Logan Motorway), WestConnex in New South Wales and the I95/395 and I495 highways in the United States. For a full schedule see the Climate tab.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\t Contractors on major construction and development projects are required to undertake a climate change risk adaptation assessment, to consider the impact of design and construction on the environment, and achieve sustainability performance ratings. \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\t Contractors on major projects are required to undertake a climate change risk adaptation assessment as part of the IS Design and As Built rating tool. \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Senior asset managers and operational staff upskilled through participation in climate change and adaptation pathway workshops for Transurban Queensland and WestConnex assets as part of CCAP development.",,"FY23 Corporate Report, Page 43, Risk Management"
11,,Metrics and Targets,Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities where such information is material.\na)\t Disclose the metrics used by the organisation to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process \nb)\t Disclose Scope 1 and 2 (and Scope 3 if appropriate) GHG emissions and the related risks\nc)\t Describe the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets,"Ã¢ÂÂ¢\t Established scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emission reduction targets for 2030 which have been verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\t We are committed to achieving net zero by 2050. 2050 GHG emission reduction target submitted to SBTi for verification, awaiting a response. \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\t Disclosures continue to include Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions as well as customer emissions, related risks and opportunities, progress against emission reduction targets, and their management.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢\t Exceeded our 2030 net zero scope 1 and 2 target (50% reduction against 2019) achieving 56% reduction at year end (seven years ahead of schedule). \n",,"FY23 Corporate Report, Page 57, Communities\n\nFY23 Sustainability Data Pack, Climate tab"
