,Acknowledgment of country,,,,,,,,
,"Transurban acknowledges the Traditional Owners of the lands across Australia and we pay respect to Elders past, present and emerging. 

As caretakers and custodians of transportation in urban communities we have a deep respect for First Nations communities and culture and seek to celebrate pride in Country through engagement with, and providing opportunities for, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We also celebrate connection to Country through artwork and design elements in our infrastructure. 

To achieve our purpose – to strengthen communities through transport – we will continue to foster positive and sustainable relationships with all communities, while progressing our efforts to contribute to Australia’s reconciliation journey. ",,,,,,,,

,Summary,,,,,,,,
,"This Sustainability Data Pack should be read in conjunction with our FY23 Corporate Reporting suite. These documents are guided by the International Integrated Reporting Framework (IIRF) . They are prepared with reference to the GRI and SASB standards. 

Selected data within this data pack has been assured by KPMG. For the full selection of metrics that have been assured please see the KPMG limited assurance opinion located within the FY23 Corporate Report, pages 223-225.

Our approach to environmental reporting includes assets and projects under our operational control where we can directly manage environmental performance ie. operational control as defined by the NGER Act (2007). This scope is the best reflection of our annual performance and ability to set scope 1 and 2 group-wide targets. Transurban scope 1 and 2 group totals exclude major projects which are under the control of construction contractors, and assets in which Transurban has an equity interest but not direct management control ('non-controlled'). Emissions related to these activities are included in relevant scope 3 categories and targets.

Table 1 shows the assets and projects included our reporting boundary, with footnotes describing changes in reporting scope for FY23.",,,,,,,,

,"About this Sustainability Data Pack
This Sustainability Data Pack (Data Pack) is prepared by Transurban Holdings Limited (ACN 098 143 429), Transurban International Limited (ACN 121 746 825) and Transurban Infrastructure Management Limited (ACN 098 147 678; AFSL 246 585) as the responsible entity of Transurban Holding Trust (ARSN 098 807 419) (together referred to as ""Transurban“, “Transurban Group” or “Group”).

This Data Pack is intended to assist investors in understanding Transurban’s performance with respect to environmental, social and governance-related objectives and metrics. It has not been prepared with regard to the unique investment and financial circumstances of any reader.

The information in this Data Pack is in summary form, does not purport to be complete, is of a general nature and does not take into account individual objectives, financial situations or particular needs and is not intended as investment or financial advice and must not be relied upon as such. Any person intending to deal in Transurban securities is recommended to obtain professional advice.

The views expressed in this Data Pack may contain information derived from publicly available sources that have not been independently verified. To the maximum extent permitted by law, none of Transurban, nor its related bodies corporate or affiliates, and none of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents or any other person: (1) accept any responsibility or liability including, without limitation, any liability arising from fault or negligence for any loss arising from this Data Pack or reliance on anything contained in or omitted from it or otherwise arising in connection with this Data Pack; (2) make any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the currency, accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the information in this Data Pack or that this Data Pack contains all material information about Transurban, or the likelihood of fulfilment of any forward-looking statements or any event or results expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement; or (3) have any obligation to correct or update the content of this Data Pack. 

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption data
Due to the inherent uncertainty and limitations associated with measuring GHG emissions and energy consumption, and that reported GHG emissions and energy figures are based on 10-12 months of data available as at the time of reporting and extrapolated to provide full year total, all GHG emissions and operational energy consumption data or references to GHG emissions and operational energy consumption volumes (including ratios or percentages) in the Sustainability Data Pack are estimates.  Where possible, historical FY22 GHG emissions and energy figures have been updated from those provided in the FY22 reporting suite to remove estimates. There may also be differences in the manner that third parties calculate or report GHG emissions or operational energy consumption data compared to Transurban, which means that third-party data may not be comparable to our data.

Forward-looking statements 
This Data Pack contains certain forward-looking statements. The words “continue”, “expect”, “forecast”, “potential”, “estimated”, “projected”, “likely”, “anticipate” and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements discuss future expectations concerning climate change, sustainability and energy transition scenarios and outcomes. The forward-looking statements are based on the information available as at the date of this Data Pack and/or the date of Transurban’s planning processes or scenario analysis processes. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Transurban, its related bodies corporate, its affiliates, and their respective Directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. There can be no assurance that actual outcomes will not differ materially from these statements, noting that information in this Data Pack is not intended to provide guidance in relation to the future performance of Transurban. 

There are usually differences between forecast and actual results because events and actual circumstances frequently do not occur as forecast and their differences may be material. 

Investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements, particularly in light of the current economic climate and significant global volatility, uncertainty and disruption.",,,,,,,,
