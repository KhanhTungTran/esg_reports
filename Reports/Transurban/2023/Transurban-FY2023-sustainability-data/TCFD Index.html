This work is overseen by members of our Executive Committee, including the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).\nâ¢ The Customer, Community and Sustainability Council (CCSC) and Climate Change Governance Committee (CCGC) provide oversight on climate-related initiatives, management priorities, and our annual disclosure.</td>

      <td>â¢\t The Climate Change Framework addresses the risks (threats and opportunities) associated with the transition to net zero, the physical impacts of climate change and sets our strategic direction and implementation plan across short, medium, and long-term time horizons. \nâ¢\tClimate change is considered as a broader strategic business risk. Climate-related risks have been identified and consolidated into four high-level strategic threats and two strategic opportunities. Materiality is determined by the potential long-term impacts, likelihood the risk will be realised, and relationship with our organisational strategy and financial systems. \nâ¢\t Transitional risks have been reviewed through three climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) at the corporate level to understand the possible short, medium, and longer-term impacts to our organisational strategy, major projects, and operational assets.\nâ¢\t We have identified potential material climate-related financial impacts and commenced development of a methodology to measure the potential qualitative, or financial, impacts of climate-related risks. The first phase involves analysing the actual direct financial impacts of a recent acute weather event, the La Nina flood event in QLD, on two Brisbane assets (Gateway Motorway and AirportlinkM7).</td>

      <td>â¢ The Climate Risk and Adaptation Guideline has been developed to ensure a consistent and aligned approach when undertaking detailed investigations and to inform asset-specific Climate Change Adaptation Plans (CCAPs). The guideline aligns with Transurbanâs Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework, and details how to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks, including those with the potential to have a material impact on the business. This includes how to escalate key risks appropriately for decision-making and to support proactive management.\nâ¢ Climate-related risks are regularly reviewed in accordance with our ERM Framework or as otherwise required (dependent on asset-specific CCAP outcomes, emerging TCFD guidance and frequency of evolving IPCC scientific findings).\nâ¢\t Asset-specific Climate Change Adaptation Plans (CCAPs) have been completed for six Queensland assets (AirportlinkM7, Clem7, Go Between Bridge, Legacy Way and the Gateway and Logan Motorway), WestConnex in New South Wales and the I95/395 and I495 highways in the United States. For a full schedule see the Climate tab.\nâ¢\t Contractors on major construction and development projects are required to undertake a climate change risk adaptation assessment, to consider the impact of design and construction on the environment, and achieve sustainability performance ratings. \nâ¢\t Contractors on major projects are required to undertake a climate change risk adaptation assessment as part of the IS Design and As Built rating tool. \nâ¢ Senior asset managers and operational staff upskilled through participation in climate change and adaptation pathway workshops for Transurban Queensland and WestConnex assets as part of CCAP development.</td>
