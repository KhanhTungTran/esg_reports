environmental permits, standards, and regulations","Many of Transurban's operating requirements have environmental obligations with performance targets and notification requirements in the event of an incident or exceedance.

No significant environmental non-compliance or monetary sanctions in FY23",
,IF-EN-160a.2,"Discussion of processes to assess and manage environmental risks associated with project design, siting, and construction","Transurban’s major projects complete a public Environmental Impact Statement /assessment in the planning phase, which informs environmental management processes during development to address key risks that vary on individual projects depending on location, project type and local stakeholder needs. These processes are documented on each project’s public website.
Refer to FY23 Corporate Report/Project updates, for more details.
Transurban’s major projects are also independently assessed using the Infrastructure Sustainability Rating Tool in Australia, and the Envision rating tool in North America. These rating tools assess performance and
improvements beyond industry standard environmental management practices, and Transurban sets contractually-required targets for major project contractors to achieve.
