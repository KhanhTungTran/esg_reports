,"Notes:
Water usage data is sourced from Transurban water invoices and operational and maintenance contractor data reports.
FY23 figures based on between 9-12 months of data at the time of reporting and extrapolated to provide full year total.
Groundwater inflows are natural drainage into road tunnels, not groundwater bore extraction. Most of this water is treated and discharged to drains and waterways. On CityLink, treated groundwater is reinjected into the aquifer to maintain appropriate aquifer and soil stability, a unique need on this asset. Additional potable water is also recharged into the aquifer as required. Potable water was previously required for this CityLink re-injection before Transurban developed groundwater treatment and recycling systems, saving significant quantities of potable water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
