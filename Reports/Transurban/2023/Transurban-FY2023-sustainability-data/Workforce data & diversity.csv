Transurban's headcount definition includes direct Transurban employees (permanent full time/part time, fixed term full time/part time, casuals) & position managed contingents (i.e. ""Supervised workers"" engaged on temporary contract basis), but excludes non-executive directors & employees on maternity leave, salary continuance & any other contingents (SOWs).
Number of males, females per employment type is a % of the Total. Where relevant, employees identifying as non-binary are included in the Total number but not under Male or Female. Gender data is no longer recorded for all supervised workers, hence these employees are included in the Total figure but not Male or Female totals for FY21 onward.
For consistency with Corporate and other reports, additional row has been added called Total excluding supervised workers which reflects the gender mix for direct employees.
