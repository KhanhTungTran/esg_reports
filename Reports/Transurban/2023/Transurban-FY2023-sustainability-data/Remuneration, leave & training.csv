All training hours exclude any independent/individual/MSA contractors and casuals as not all are required to complete training.
Training data only includes mandatory compliance learning, centrally delivered leadership programs and LinkedIn learning data. It does not include any learning that is undertaking at the individual, team, or business unit levels.
Significant decrease between FY22 and FY23 training hours can be attributed to some courses only running bi-annually and the senior leadership program not being run in FY23.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
