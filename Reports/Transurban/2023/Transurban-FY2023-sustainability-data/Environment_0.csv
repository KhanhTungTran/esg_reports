4,,"For TransurbanÃ¢ÂÂs group total environmental metrics, we include assets and projects under our operational control where we can directly manage environmental performance. This scope is the best reflection of our annual performance and ability to set scope 1 and 2 group-wide targets.\n\nTransurban group totals for scope 1 and 2 exclude major projects which are under the control of construction contractors, and assets in which Transurban has an equity interest but not direct management control (e.g. M7). These assets and projects are monitored individually, but generally excluded from group-wide scope 1 and 2 totals.\n\nIn addition to this data pack, Transurban reports to regulators for operational environmental requirements including the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Act 2007. We also report data and performance to investor-led ESG benchmarks including Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), Global Real Estate Benchmark (GRESB) and CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project). \n\nTable 1 (in the Summary tab) outlines the assets and projects covered by our reporting, and footnotes on relevant tabs describe changes in reporting scope for FY23.",,,,,

6,,"GHG TARGETS\nNear-term targets (SBTi validated)1\n- Reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by FY30 from a FY19 base year.\n- Reduce scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services (associated with road infrastructure maintenance and operation) 22% per vehicle kilometre travelled by customers by FY30 from a FY19 base year. \n- Reduce scope 3 GHG emissions from capital goods by 55% per $M capital expenditure by FY30 from a FY19 base year.\n\nNet Zero target (currently seeking validation with SBTi)\n- Transurban commits to reach net-zero GHG emissions across the value chain by 2050, reducing absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 90% by FY50 from a FY19 base year.\n\nENERGY TARGETS\n- Deliver 10% energy efficiency savings by 2023 from a 2013 base year.2\n\nWASTE TARGETS3\n- 80% operational and maintenance waste diverted from landfill by 2025.\n- 95% of major projects construction and demolition diverted from landfill (annual). \n- 95% of major projects spoil waste diverted from landfill (annual).\n",,,,,
7,,Environment data methodology,,,,,
8,,Transurban GHG emissions,,,,,
9,,"Transurban uses The Greenhouse Gas Protocol to define our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Several sources provide GHG emissions factors and calculation methods:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Scope 1 and 2 emissions are calculated based on the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act (NGER). US electricity emissions are calculated using factors from the Environmental Protection AgencyÃ¢ÂÂs eGRID. Canadian electricity emissions are calculated using factors from the Canadian national greenhouse gas inventory.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Scope 2 Ã¢ÂÂmarket-basedÃ¢ÂÂ include purchase of Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) via TransurbanÃ¢ÂÂs renewable Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs). Electricity covered by LGCs is considered zero-emissions, any remaining electricity emissions are based on a Ã¢ÂÂResidual Mix FactorÃ¢ÂÂ for average non-renewable grid electricity, in accordance with AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Scope 2 Ã¢ÂÂlocation-basedÃ¢ÂÂ emissions are based on state grid electricity factors at the point of purchase. \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Scope 3 emissions from waste, fuel and electricity supply networks are calculated using the Australian Government National Greenhouse Accounts (NGA) Factors. \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Scope 3 emissions from business air travel are calculated using factors from UK DEFRA guidelines recommended by the GHG Protocol.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Scope 3 emissions from TransurbanÃ¢ÂÂs supply chain (Ã¢ÂÂPurchased goods and servicesÃ¢ÂÂ) are estimated based on procurement spend, and Environmentally Extended Input-Output (EEIO) GHG emissions factors per dollar spent on different supply chain sectors. This method is consistent with guidelines from the GHG Protocol.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Scope 3 emissions from Transurban major projects (Ã¢ÂÂCapital GoodsÃ¢ÂÂ) are estimated based on major project spending each year, and GHG inventories provided by major projects as part of the Infrastructure Sustainability (IS) Rating Tool. GHG emissions reported include fuel and electricity consumed during major project construction, as well as the embodied emissions of raw materials used (e.g. concrete, asphalt, steel etc.). \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Customer (motorists using our roads) travel emissions are not included within TransurbanÃ¢ÂÂs scope 3 boundary as defined by the GHG Reporting Protocol. Reducing these emissions is an important part of our strategy including our ability to influence. We continue to report customer travel emissions in our annual sustainability disclosures. \t\t\t\t",,,,,
10,,Waste,,,,,
11,,"We categorise our waste into the following categories: Major Projects, Assets and Offices. To reduce waste, we continue to work with our contractors on major projects on measures to achieve our annual targets. \n\nWhile we continue to work towards our waste targets set in FY22, we have also begun preliminary work that will inform a target for minor capital expenditure works and Transurban controlled offices.\n\nFor this reporting period office waste data was collected from Wasteflex, our national waste broker, and respective office facility managers, JLL in Sydney and Walker in Melbourne. Operational and maintenance waste is collected from contractors that have completed work hours on assets.\nWaste and recycling totals fluctuate significantly each year depending on maintenance cycles on individual assets. Some waste-generating activities only occur every few years or decade on each asset, such as road surface re-sheeting, asphalt recycling and maintenance works post-flooding events.",,,,,
12,,Customer travel emissions,,,,,
13,,"GHG emissions from customer vehicles on our assets are calculated based on total distances travelled, vehicle type, average speed, and fuel efficiency models from software program COPERT Australia.\n\nTransurbanÃ¢ÂÂs traffic and tolling systems record information such as vehicle class and entry and exit points of vehicles, as well as vehicle type. Supplementary information on some assets includes vehicle origin-destination studies, independent travel time studies, and assumptions based on the physical dimensions of assets. This data is used to calculate the total Vehicle Kilometres Travelled (VKT) on each asset. Travel speeds are based on GPS data from external provider TomTom to determine average travel speeds on Transurban assets.\n\nTransurban calculates resulting emissions using vehicle GHG emission factors that are sensitive to vehicle type, fuel and travel speed, sourced from COPERT Australia, and based on vehicle emissions testing research for a range of vehicle types and conditions. Vehicle fuel efficiency is based on assuming average vehicle types travelling on Transurban roads. Conservative emissions estimates are made by using fuel efficiency data for vehicle manufacturing standards that have been in place for over 10 years. Actual GHG emissions may vary due to actual vehicle type, age, driving style and other factors that are impractical to estimate.\n\nWhen not available in actual data, some assumptions regarding vehicle and fuel type are estimated based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Motor Vehicle Census 2020.",,,,,
14,,Customer travel savings,,,,,
15,,"Customer time, fuel and GHG savings in using Transurban toll roads compared to alternative routes are based on travel conditions on the tolled and un-tolled road (distance, time, speed, fuel efficiency) throughout the year. Estimates are based on the actual trips taken on each Transurban toll road, compared with a scenario in which the same number of trips were taken on the best alternative un-tolled route. The comparison is made based on a typical reference trip with the same start and end point, either using the toll road or the next best available un-tolled road.",,,,,
16,,Environmental data estimates,,,,,
17,,"We provide detailed environmental data in our Corporate Report to accompany financial statements. Some environmental data requires a longer period to collect and verify compared to financial data. To align with financial reporting timelines, some estimations of incomplete data is required, using forecast environmental data estimates for the final 1-3 months of FY23.\n\nEstimates of key metrics are included in the scope of external assurance by KPMG. It is not expected that these estimates will materially affect environmental data totals. Where estimation has been used, written commentary about Transurban performance trends allows for the uncertainty in this estimation. If an annual trend in environmental performance is within the margin of error for estimation used, it will not be used as the basis for any significant statements of performance.\n\nEnvironmental data will be fully available shortly after the publication of the Corporate Report. If figures vary materially from those published in the Corporate Report, or if corrections are required to ensure past year data remains consistent with future reporting scope, a revision and restatement will be made in the following yearÃ¢ÂÂs Report.",,,,,
18,,General,,,,,
19,,Discrepancies in totals may be due to rounding.,,,,,
20,,"Notes\n1 We acknowledge SBTi regularly reviews their methodology and we continue to stay across latest updates.\n2 Target boundary includes all assets as of 2016 (backcast to 2013), resulting in a total energy efficiency savings target of 56,366 GJ per annum across all assets within the target boundary.\n3 The recycled target only includes general and inert waste. Prescribed, liquid and spoil waste not included in operational waste target.",,,,,
