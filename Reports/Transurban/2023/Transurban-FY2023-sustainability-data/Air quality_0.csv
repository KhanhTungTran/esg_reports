27,,"Notes:\nReported Air Emissions figures are based on 11-12 months of data available as at the time of reporting and extrapolated to provide full year total.\nMonitoring on each tunnel varies according to requirements set by government and regulators. Tunnels are monitored for air pollutant concentration in-tunnel, at ventilation outlets or at ambient locations to ensure that air quality is maintained within safe conditions defined by our operating licences. Tunnels reported above are those that also monitor total annual pollutant load (in tonnes) emitted from tunnel ventilation. This can be aggregated as a single annual figure, whereas concentration-based monitoring is an ongoing live measure.\nMore detailed live air quality data on Transurban tunnels is available on the Linkt website. This includes tunnels not reported above:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
