,"Notes:
Reported Air Emissions figures are based on 11-12 months of data available as at the time of reporting and extrapolated to provide full year total.
Monitoring on each tunnel varies according to requirements set by government and regulators. Tunnels are monitored for air pollutant concentration in-tunnel, at ventilation outlets or at ambient locations to ensure that air quality is maintained within safe conditions defined by our operating licences. Tunnels reported above are those that also monitor total annual pollutant load (in tonnes) emitted from tunnel ventilation. This can be aggregated as a single annual figure, whereas concentration-based monitoring is an ongoing live measure.
More detailed live air quality data on Transurban tunnels is available on the Linkt website. This includes tunnels not reported above:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"·        WestConnex New M4, WestConnex M8, and M5 East monitor air quality in-tunnel, at ventilation and in ambient external locations, but do not have a specific annual total load requirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"·        NorthConnex monitors air quality in-tunnel, at ventilation and in ambient external locations, but do not have a specific annual total load requirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"·        Transurban's Queensland tunnels (Clem7, Legacy Way, AirportlinkM7) monitor in-tunnel and ambient conditions but do not have ventilation totals that can be reported alongside figures above.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,·        Hills M2 and Eastern Distributor feature shorter enclosed sections that do not require the same extent of air quality management as longer tunnels. In-tunnel air quality is monitored against air  quality goals but not required by regulations to be reported.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
