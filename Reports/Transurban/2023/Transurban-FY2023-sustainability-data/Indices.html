The majority of SASB metrics are topics that Transurban has reported in its Corporate Report or other communications for many years. \n\nThe SASB Index guides companies' disclosure of financially material sustainability information to their investors. The standards identify the subset of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues most relevant to financial performance in various industries. SASB Standards are maintained by the Value Reporting Foundation, a global non-profit organisation.\n\nThe SASB Index tab shows where content for each SASB indicator can be found within Transurban’s reporting suite or provides additional information or response. Transurban’s officially listed SASB sector is Infrastructure Engineering &amp; Construction Services (IF-EN) which reflects our business as an infrastructure operator. We have provided commentary where Transurban’s preferred metrics for each topic differ from SASB.</td>

We continue to consider all the TCFD’s recommendations and have outlined the next steps we will be taking through to FY25 and beyond in our Disclosure. A summary of how we have addressed the recommendations is available in this pack, as well as the metrics we continue to consider (under the 'Climate' tab).</td>

We believe more can be done to contribute to the UN SDG targets above and beyond the official indicator set. For this reason, we also list our own, Transurban-specific, indicators and targets and summarise our performance against these.\n\nMore information regarding our FY23 performance for each of the nine UN SDGs that are particularly relevant to Transurban is included throughout our FY23 Corporate Report.</td>
