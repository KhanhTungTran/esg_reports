,GRI INDEX
,"Transurban reports non-financial data with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. In FY23 we are reporting with reference to GRI's revised Universal 2021 standards. A summary table shows where content for each GRI indicator can be found within Transurban’s reporting suite or provides additional information or response. Where a metric is not applicable or not available, we have provided related commentary on the topic."
,
,SASB INDEX
,"Transurban reports against the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) sector standards as this framework is increasingly used by our investors and stakeholders. The majority of SASB metrics are topics that Transurban has reported in its Corporate Report or other communications for many years. 

The SASB Index guides companies' disclosure of financially material sustainability information to their investors. The standards identify the subset of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues most relevant to financial performance in various industries. SASB Standards are maintained by the Value Reporting Foundation, a global non-profit organisation.

The SASB Index tab shows where content for each SASB indicator can be found within Transurban’s reporting suite or provides additional information or response. Transurban’s officially listed SASB sector is Infrastructure Engineering & Construction Services (IF-EN) which reflects our business as an infrastructure operator. We have provided commentary where Transurban’s preferred metrics for each topic differ from SASB."

,TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE (TCFD)
,"Climate change influences our business and operations now and will continue to do so into the future. We are committed to transition our business to net zero emissions by 2050 and are implementing broader business resilience and adaptation measure across our assets and projects. 
We have been an early adopter of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and our 5th disclosure report has been integrated into our FY23 Corporate Report at page 39-49.

Our climate change disclosure is structured around the TCFD themes; governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. We continue to consider all the TCFD’s recommendations and have outlined the next steps we will be taking through to FY25 and beyond in our Disclosure. A summary of how we have addressed the recommendations is available in this pack, as well as the metrics we continue to consider (under the 'Climate' tab)."
,UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
,"Transurban is committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). The UN SDG tab details Transurban’s FY23 progress against the nine UN SDGs that are particularly relevant to Transurban and the associated targets and indicators that apply to our business. We believe more can be done to contribute to the UN SDG targets above and beyond the official indicator set. For this reason, we also list our own, Transurban-specific, indicators and targets and summarise our performance against these.

More information regarding our FY23 performance for each of the nine UN SDGs that are particularly relevant to Transurban is included throughout our FY23 Corporate Report."
