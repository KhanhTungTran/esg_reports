115,,Employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews (%),Under our Motivate framework employees with more than three months tenure in a role are expected to complete three quarterly performance conversations with their People Leader across the year (the conversation in the third quarter of the year is optional). These conversations also include a review of development goals. This metric is calculated by taking the percentage of eligible employees (split by gender) that completed a conversation in each of the three quarters for the year and averaging this percentage to calculate the annual number. This approach is considered appropriate given the population in each quarter is different (new hires and terminations etc.)

117,,Exposure to Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) sectors for Financial Institutions,"Financial exposure to sectors considered to have material nature-related dependencies and impacts, as identified by the TNFD (the 'TNFD reference sectors').\n\nThis measure is calculated as the TCE for customers in each TNFD reference sector, excluding exposures for the committed portion of secondary market trading and underwriting risk.\n\nCustomers are classified to industry sectors within our underlying loan origination systems utilising the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) 2006 edition and its predecessor 1993 edition. To determine the financial exposure attributable to each TNFD reference sector we apply the ANZSIC1993 Ã¢ÂÂ 2006 and ANZSIC 2006 Ã¢ÂÂ International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Rev.4 Correspondence Tables to map the ANZSIC code classification for each lending exposure to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) codes used within TNFD Annex 1 of the Sector guidance, Additional guidance for financial institutions Version 2.0 September 2023. Our approach to classifying our lending exposures for TNFD reporting purposes is expected to evolve as we improve our gathering, analysis and reporting of data, acknowledging the current data quality challenges for our underlying lending portfolio.\n\nThe TNFD recognises that: 1) financial institutions have a number of data dependencies on their investees, customers and clients; and 2) when obtaining data on portfolio exposures, financial institutions will often rely on external data providers, and at times, proxy and/ or modelled data. It also recognises that, as companies start to assess and disclose aligned with the TNFD Recommendations, it can be expected that more and better quality data and analytics will become available and that financial institutions may need to make estimates based on the best available information about the locations and activities of companies in preparing its metrics and disclosures."
