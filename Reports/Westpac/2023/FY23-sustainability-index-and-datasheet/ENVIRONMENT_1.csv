109,,Westpac Group is focused on actively reducing its emissions. This is complemented by the purchase of carbon credits to offset residual emissions that occur from our operations. Westpac GroupÃ¢ÂÂs Australia and New Zealand operations maintain carbon neutral certification under the Australian GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs Climate Active Standard for Organisations and the New Zealand ToitÃÂ« net carbonzero programme.

126,,"2. Due to an update in the New Zealand Ministry for the EnvironmentÃ¢ÂÂs emission factor for electricity emissions in 2023, Westpac NZ has restated the electricity emissions for the past three years (2020-2022) to reflect impacts to our footprint as per the New Zealand ToitÃÂ« net carbonzero programme requirements. Incremental carbon offsets have been purchased and retired in 2023 by Westpac Group to bridge the 2020 to 2022 difference between emissions and purchase offsets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
127,,"3. Climate Active Standard allows organisations to claim default delivered renewable electricity from the grid, such as LGC surrenders made by a jurisdiction with a renewable electricity target. RE100 Standard allows claims of default delivered renewables only where relevant information from the electricity supplier is available. Westpac has not claimed the default renewables benefit in its market-based emissions figures when LGC were not evidenced. This results in a difference between Westpac's market based emissions reported in table 2 (above) and market based emission in the carbon offset summary table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
