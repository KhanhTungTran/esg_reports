62,,Parental Leave,"Employees entitled to parental leave includes permanent and max term employees from Australia and New Zealand. Employees outside these regions have been excluded from the calculation.\n\nEmployees that took parental leave includes those taking primary or secondary carer parental leave of any duration or frequency in the reporting period. \n\nEmployees that returned to work in the reporting period excludes those who separated while on parental leave, and those who commenced parental leave in the reporting period and are still on parental leave at the end of the financial year.\n\nReturn to work rate (%) is the percent of employees who returned to work divided by the total number of employees who took parental leave during the reporting period. The return to work rate excludes employees with parental leave that continues after the end of the financial year.\n\nEmployees still employed 12 months after return to work is calculated from those employees who finished their parental leave in the previous reporting period, i.e., for 2023 that would be between 1 October 2021 and 30 September 2022.\n\nRetention rate (%) is the percent of employees who returned to work 12 months after their last parental leave break in the previous reporting period, divided by the total number of employees who completed their parental leave in the previous reporting period."

65,,Purchased electricity Ã¢ÂÂ T&D losses (tCOÃ¢ÂÂ-e),"Calculation Boundary: Electricity losses attributable to the transmission and distribution (T&D) of electricity to the end user. For Australia and New Zealand, this includes emissions associated with the electricity used by commercial, retail, data centre, subsidiary and ATM sites under the GroupÃ¢ÂÂs operational and non-operational control.\n\nCalculation Methodology: Location-based method calculates emissions by multiplying the converted activity by the transmission and distribution emission factor, sourced from the National Greenhouse Accounts Factors and Ministry for the Environment Summary of Emissions Factors, for Australia and New Zealand respectively.\nFor Australia, market-based method calculates emissions by multiplying the residual electricity activity data by the Australian Residual Mix Factor calculated under the Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard for Organisations. For New Zealand, market-based method calculates emission by multiplying the electricity activity data by the New Zealand Residual Supply Factor sourced from the Certified Energy, New Zealand Energy Certification System.\n\nLocation and market-based method emission calculations are detailed under the purchased electricity (tCOÃ¢ÂÂ-e) category. \n\nActivity data source: Utility invoices and supplier records."
66,,Purchased electricity Ã¢ÂÂ Third party data centre and ATMs (tCOÃ¢ÂÂ-e),Calculation Boundary: Purchase electricity consumption includes: Third party data centres (Australia and New Zealand) and ATMs (Australia only). \n\nCalculation Methodology: For Australia Third party data centre electricity activity data is based on invoice records provided by electricity suppliers. Third party ATM electricity data is estimated based on average ATM usage per day by machine type multiplied by number of days the ATM was operational over the reporting period. The total usage is apportioned by the supplier to Westpac. \n\nLocation and market-based emission calculations and factors applied are as detailed under the purchased electricity (tCOÃ¢ÂÂ-e) category. \n\nActivity data source: Supplier records.\n
67,,Purchased electricity (tCOÃ¢ÂÂ-e),"Calculation Boundary: Indirect scope 2 emissions from electricity consumed by commercial, retail, data centre and subsidiary sites under the WestpacÃ¢ÂÂs operational control.\n\nCalculation Methodology: For Australia, electricity activity data is based on invoice records provided by electricity suppliers. Where invoice data is not available, missing data is accrued using a seasonally adjusted weighted average method to derive an estimate. In some cases, invoices are not received for a Westpac site and electricity usage is estimated using actual electricity data per NLA intensity (kWh/m2) for similar properties for which invoice data is available. \n\nThe location-based method calculates scope 2 emissions by multiplying the quantity of grid-imported electricity by the applicable State or Territory emission factor, as listed in the NGER Measurement Determination. \n\nThe market-based method allows total electricity consumption to be reduced by the MWh of renewable electricity consumed, covered by renewable EACs (LGCs), before applying the Australian residual mix factor (RMF) to the remaining electricity. The RMF is used to convert any electricity usage in a carbon account not matched by renewable electricity purchases (accounted for through retired LGCs). \n\nThe RE100 Standard allows organisations to claim default delivered renewable electricity from the grid (such as renewable electricity supplied under a compliance mandate such as the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET)) only where relevant information from the electricity supplier is available to justify the claim. Where verification is not available, Westpac has not claimed the default renewables benefit in its market-based emissions figures.\n\nThe Climate Active Standard allows organisations to claim default delivered renewable electricity from the grid, such as LGC surrenders made by a jurisdiction with a renewable electricity target (for example, the ACT GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs Renewable Energy Target) as renewable electricity consumption for activities occurring in that jurisdiction.\n\nThis results in a difference between the scope 2 market-based emissions figure reported in WestpacÃ¢ÂÂs Sustainability Index and Datasheet and those reported in WestpacÃ¢ÂÂs Climate Active Carbon Neutral Position Disclosure Statements.\n\nFor New Zealand, electricity activity data is based on invoice records provided by electricity suppliers. Where invoice data is not available at the time of reporting, missing data is accrued based on historical usage. \n\nThe location-based method calculates scope 2 emissions by multiplying the quantity of electricity by the grid-average electricity emissions factor, as listed in the Ministry for the Environment Summary of Emissions Factors. The market-based method calculates scope 2 emissions by multiplying the quantity of electricity by the New Zealand residual supply factor (RSF) per Certified Energy, New Zealand Energy Certification System.\nActivity data source: Utility invoices."
68,,Refrigerants (tCOÃ¢ÂÂ-e),"Calculation Boundary: Direct scope 1 emissions from Kyoto hydrofluorocarbons (refrigerants) used in commercial air conditioning units.\n\nCalculation Methodology: Refrigerant emissions are calculated by multiplying the refrigerant capacity (kg) with the Global Warming Potential (GWP) value of the relevant gas type to determine the total stock in carbon dioxide equivalence (CO2-e) tonnes. A default leakage rate is applied to the total stock, in line with NGER Measurement Determination and Ministry for the Environment Summary of Emissions Factors, for Australia and New Zealand respectively.\n\nActivity data source: Refrigerant capacity (kg) and gas type per nameplate on equipment, as recorded within the refrigerant register."

73,,Sectors that may face relatively higher growth constraints from transition risk,"To assess the possible implications of climate-related transition risks, the Group used scenario analysis to study how the Australian economy, electricity market and other industry sectors might perform when emissions are constrained in line with 1.5-degree transition pathways.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ The emission constraints used in the modelling were informed by the International Energy AgencyÃ¢ÂÂs Sustainable Development Scenario, the International Renewable Energy AgencyÃ¢ÂÂs Renewable Energy Roadmap and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 Degrees;\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ ANZSIC (Australian and New Zealand Standard Industry Classification) codes were used to map to specific industries, and then to sectors;\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Each sectorÃ¢ÂÂs performance under the scenario pathway was analysed and categorised according to risk profile;\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Sectors whose medium (2030) and long-term (2050) performance under a scenario deviated by more than one standard deviation below average GDP growth were classified as Ã¢ÂÂhigher riskÃ¢ÂÂ; and\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ These results were applied to the Australian Business and Institutional lending portfolio to assess the extent of current exposure to these higher risk sectors."
