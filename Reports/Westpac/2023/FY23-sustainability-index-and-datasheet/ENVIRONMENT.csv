,"2. Due to an update in the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment’s emission factor for electricity emissions in 2023, Westpac NZ has restated the electricity emissions for the past three years (2020-2022) to reflect  impacts to our footprint as per the New Zealand Toitū net carbonzero programme requirements.

,"3. Climate Active Standard allows organisations to claim default delivered renewable electricity from the grid, such as LGC surrenders made by a jurisdiction with a renewable electricity target. RE100 Standard allows claims of default delivered renewables only where relevant information from the electricity supplier is available. Westpac has not claimed the default renewables benefit in its market-based emissions figures when LGC were not evidenced. This results in a difference between Westpac's market based emissions reported in table 2 (above) and market based emission in the carbon offset summary table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
