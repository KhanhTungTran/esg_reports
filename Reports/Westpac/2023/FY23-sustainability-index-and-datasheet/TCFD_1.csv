26,,a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process.,"Organizations should provide the key metrics used to measure and manage climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as metrics consistent with the cross-industry, climate-related metric categories.\nOrganizations should consider including metrics on climate-related risks associated with water, energy, land use, and waste management where relevant and applicable.\nWhere climate-related issues are material, organizations should consider describing whether and how related performance metrics are incorporated into remuneration policies.\nWhere relevant, organizations should provide their internal carbon prices as well as climate-related opportunity metrics such as revenue from products and services designed for a low-carbon economy. \nMetrics should be provided for historical periods to allow for trend analysis.\nWhere appropriate, organizations should consider providing forward-looking metrics for the cross-industry, climate-related metric categories, consistent with their business or strategic planning time horizons. In addition, where not apparent, organizations should provide a description of the methodologies used to calculate or estimate climate-related metrics.","Banks should provide the metrics used to assess the impact of (transition and physical) climate-related risks on their lending and other financial intermediary business activities in the short, medium, and long term. Metrics provided may relate to credit exposure, equity and debt holdings, or trading positions, broken down by:\nÃ¢ÂÂ Industry\nÃ¢ÂÂ Geography\nÃ¢ÂÂ Credit quality (e.g., investment grade or non-investment grade, internal rating\nsystem)\nÃ¢ÂÂ Average tenor\nBanks should also provide the amount and percentage of carbon-related assets relative to total assets as well as the amount of lending and other financing connected with climate-related opportunities.","See our 2023 Annual Report: Section 1 Ã¢ÂÂ Creating value for the Environment; Section 2 Ã¢ÂÂ Sustainability governance and risk management\n\nSee our 2023 Sustainability Index and Datasheet - tabs Environment; and Lending\n\nSee our 2023 Climate Report:\nPage 6 - 7: FY23 Highlights\nPage 21 - 22: Strategy (Net-zero, climate resilient operations)\nPage 27 - 28, 32: Strategy (Supporting customers transition to net-zero)\nPage 40 - 44: Risk Management\n",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All organizations should consider disclosing Scope 3 GHG emissions.\nGHG emissions should be calculated in line with the GHG Protocol methodology to allow for aggregation and comparability across organizations and jurisdictions. As appropriate, organizations should consider providing related, generally accepted industry-specific GHG efficiency ratios.\nGHG emissions and associated metrics should be provided for historical periods to allow for trend analysis. In addition, where not apparent, organizations should provide a description of the methodologies used to calculate or estimate the metrics.",None,"See our 2023 Annual Report: Section 1 Ã¢ÂÂ Creating value for the Environment\n\nSee our 2023 Sustainability Index and Datasheet - tabs Environment; and Lending\n\nSee our 2023 Climate Report:\nPage 22: Strategy (Net-zero, climate resilient operations)\nPage 28: Strategy (Supporting customers transition to net-zero)\n",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,,c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.,"Organizations should describe their key climate-related targets such as those related to GHG emissions, water usage, energy usage, etc., and in line with anticipated regulatory requirements or market constraints or other goals. Other goals may include efficiency or financial goals, financial loss tolerances, avoided GHG emissions through the entire product life cycle, or net revenue goals for products and services designed for a low-carbon economy. \nIn describing their targets, organizations should consider including the following:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ whether the target is absolute or intensity based;\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ time frames over which the target applies;\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ base year from which progress is measured; and\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ key performance indicators used to assess progress against targets.\nOrganizations disclosing medium-term or long-term targets should also disclose associated interim targets in aggregate or by business line, where available.\nWhere not apparent, organizations should provide a description of the methodologies used to calculate targets and measures.",None,"See our 2023 Annual Report: Section 1 Ã¢ÂÂ Creating value for the Environment\n\nSee our 2023 Sustainability Index and Datasheet - tabs Environment; and Lending\n\nSee our 2023 Climate Report:\nPage 18 - 20: Strategy (Net-zero, climate resilient operations)\nPage 24 - 25, 28, 35: Strategy (Supporting customers transition to net-zero)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
