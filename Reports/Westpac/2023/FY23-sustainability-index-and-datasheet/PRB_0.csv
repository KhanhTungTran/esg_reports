To this end, we will set and publish targets where we can have the most significant impacts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,,"2.1ÃÂ ÃÂ Ã Impact Analysis: \nShow that your bank has performed an impact analysis of its portfolio/s to identify its most significant impact areas and determine priority areas for target-setting. The impact analysis shall be updated regularly and fulfil the following requirements/elements (a-d) : \n\na) Scope: What is the scope of your bankÃ¢ÂÂs impact analysis? Please describe which parts of the bankÃ¢ÂÂs core business areas, products/services across the main geographies that the bank operates in (as described under 1.1) have been considered in the impact analysis. Please also describe which areas have not yet been included, and why.\n\nb)ÃÂ Portfolio composition: Has your bank considered the composition of its portfolio (in %) in the analysis? Please provide proportional composition of your portfolio globally and per geographical scope\ni) by sectors & industries for business, corporate and investment banking portfolios (i.e. sector exposure or industry breakdown in %), and/or \nii) by products & services and by types of customers for consumer and retail banking portfolios. \nIf your bank has taken another approach to determine the bankÃ¢ÂÂs scale of exposure, please elaborate, to show how you have considered where the bankÃ¢ÂÂs core business/major activities lie in terms of industries or sectors.\n\nc)ÃÂ Context: What are the main challenges and priorities related to sustainable development in the main countries/regions in which your bank and/or your clients operate? Please describe how these have been considered, including what stakeholders you have engaged to help inform this element of the impact analysis. \n\nd)ÃÂ ÃÂ Performance measurement: Has your bank identified which sectors & industries as well as types of customers financed or invested in are causing the strongest actual positive or negative impacts? Please describe how you assessed the performance of these, using appropriate indicators related to significant impact areas that apply to your bankÃ¢ÂÂs context. \nIn determining priority areas for target-setting among its areas of most significant impact, you should consider the bankÃ¢ÂÂs current performance levels, i.e. qualitative and/or quantitative indicators and/or proxies of the social, economic and environmental impacts resulting from the bankÃ¢ÂÂs activities and provision of products and services. If you have identified climate and/or financial health&inclusion as your most significant impact areas, please also refer to the applicable indicators in the Annex. \nIf your bank has taken another approach to assess the intensity of impact resulting from the bankÃ¢ÂÂs activities and provision of products and services, please describe this. \n","We used several methodologies and tools to undertake our impact analysis, with a particular focus on the consumer and business banking portfolios in Australia. \nAs per our Annual Report Note 2 Segment reporting, our Australian consumer division represents more than half of our earnings so to analyse our portfolio impacts, we applied the UNEP FI impact analysis consumer banking module (UNcb). In this analysis we used customer numbers across key products including saving accounts, home loans and credit cards. Our institutional banking activities, along with our New Zealand and Pacific businesses were not covered in the analysis at this stage.\nApplying the UNcb we determined that our consumer portfolio was strongly associated with impacts that could include modern slavery, child labour, health and safety, employment, education, socio-economic convergence, gender equality, inclusion and diversity, indigenous people, climate stability, culture and heritage, water, habitat, species, resources intensity and waste.\n\nWe completed our review with a number of international and national resources (including the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Action Plan for Australia and New Zealand, the SASB materiality matrix, the GRI materiality assessment process and the UNEP FI Context module). We didnÃ¢ÂÂt engage with external stakeholders specifically for the purpose of PRBs specifically, however we regularly engage with stakeholders through our yearly sustainability reporting process, as described on our website, and with external stakeholders as part of our materiality assessment process. \n\nThe identified challenges and priorities led us to look more closely at climate change and human rights, because these had already been identified as high priorities and because they are areas of particular interest by our stakeholders. \n\nWe have considered our contribution to climate change and measure our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions to monitor our impact. We have set targets for scope 1, 2 and 3 (upstream) emissions. Given the importance of scope 3 (financed emissions), we measure these at a Group level for customers we lend to. To determine sectors that were the primary contributors to climate change, we relied on the list of carbon-intensive sectors identified by NZBA. We conducted further analysis on each of those sectors and have established 2030 emission reduction targets for 12 sectors. This is described in our Climate Report. \n\nWhile the impact on human rights is relatively low in our core markets of Australia and New Zealand and in our area of operations, we recognise this risk is higher in our supply chain and with the use of our products. We continuously try to improve our identification and assessment to such risks, and this is described in our Human Rights Position Statement and our Modern Slavery Statement. Related performance indicators are included therein. \n\nGiven our analysis we concluded that climate change and human rights were the bankÃ¢ÂÂs areas of most significant impact. We are working with our customers and suppliers to discuss these matters to identify viable transition opportunities, and reduce risks related to both climate change and human rights.","2020-2023 Sustainability Strategy \n2023 Annual Report: Sustainability governance and risk management; Material sustainability topics; Creating value for the environment; Creating value for the community \n2023 Sustainability Index and Datasheet: tabs Lending, Economic and social; and Sustainability Strategy \nWebsite: Sustainability Oversight\nWebsite: Listening to Stakeholders\nWebsite: Approach to Sustainability Risk Management\nWebsite: Safer Children, Safer Communities \n2023 Climate Report: Strategy Appendix (Climate Change Position Statement)\nHuman Rights Position Statement and Action Plan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,,Please provide your bankÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion/statement if it has fulfilled the requirements regarding Impact Analysis.,"We have fulfilled our Impact Analysis requirements by identifying the areas in which we have the most significant potential positive and negative impact through our Sustainability Strategy and Climate and Human Rights Action Plans, which also considers inputs from our materiality assessments. We have joined the NZBA and set interim 2030 financed emissions targets in 8 NZBA sectors in lending portfolios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,,"2.2ÃÂ ÃÂ Ã Target Setting \nShow that your bank has set and published a minimum of two targets which address at least two different areas of most significant impact that you identified in your impact analysis. The targets have to be Specific, Measurable (qualitative or quantitative), Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound (SMART). Please disclose the following elements of target setting (a-d), for each target separately:\na) Alignment: which international, regional or national policy frameworks to align your bankÃ¢ÂÂs portfolio with have you identified as relevant? Show that the selected indicators and targets are linked to and drive alignment with and greater contribution to appropriate Sustainable Development Goals, the goals of the Paris Agreement, and other relevant international, national or regional frameworks. \n\nb) Baseline: Have you determined a baseline for selected indicators and assessed the current level of alignment? Please disclose the indicators used as well as the year of the baseline. You can build upon the performance measurement undertaken in 2.1 to determine the baseline for your target.\nA package of indicators has been developed for climate change mitigation and financial health & inclusion to guide and support banks in their target setting and implementation journey. The overview of indicators can be found in the Annex of this template. If your bank has prioritized climate mitigation and/or financial health & inclusion as (one of) your most significant impact areas, it is strongly recommended to report on the indicators in the Annex, using an overview table including the impact area, all relevant indicators and the corresponding indicator codes. In case you have identified other and/or additional indicators as relevant to determine the baseline and assess the level of alignment towards impact driven targets, please disclose these.\n\nc) SMART targets (incl. key performance indicators (KPIs) ): Please disclose the targets for your first and your second area of most significant impact, if already in place (as well as further impact areas, if in place). Which KPIs are you using to monitor progress towards reaching the target? Please disclose.\n\nd) Action plan: which actions including milestones have you defined to meet the set targets? Please describe. Please also show that your bank has analysed and acknowledged significant (potential) indirect impacts of the set targets within the impact area or on other impact areas and that it has set out relevant actions to avoid, mitigate, or compensate potential negative impacts.","We have been reporting against global reporting standards for more than 10 years and already published our sustainability strategy and targets, prior to our 2023 PRBs impact analysis. We have just refreshed our Sustainability Strategy which sets out a range goals, targets, initiatives and measures. These are linked to our business practices and the SDGs and detailed in tab Ã¢ÂÂSustainability StrategyÃ¢ÂÂ. Our updated sustainability strategy is aligned our new purpose and strategic intent and was also informed by our material sustainability issues. The new strategy is not directly based on the PRB, but because it has been based on our purpose and material sustainability issues, it is closely aligned.\n\nUnder our ambition of Ã¢ÂÂRespecting human rights and amplifying Indigenous voicesÃ¢ÂÂ we have set up the target to ""Invest up to $30 million to raise awareness of child exploitation and support child protection, and establish a fund to accelerate the development of collaborative technologies"". \n\nUnder our ambition to Ã¢ÂÂBecome a net-zero climate resilient bankÃ¢ÂÂ we have plans and targets to:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Reduce our scope 1&2 and scope 3 upstream emissions\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Reduce our scope 3 financed emissions including by establishing 12 NZBA sector emission reductions targets within 8 of the 9 carbon-intensive NZBA sectors. \n\nOur 2023 Climate Report, discloses our climate performance and progress against our scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 upstream emissions targets, as well as our scope 3 financed emissions including progress under our NZBA sector targets. \n\nOur progress on human rights is disclosed within the following documents:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 2023 Sustainability Index and Datasheet: tab Sustainability Strategy - includes our progress against human rights targets. \nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 2023 Annual Report - Community - provide a snapshot of our human rights related actions for FY23.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Modern Slavery Statements FY22 - comprehensive report on our human rights impacts from our operations and supply chain.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 2022-2025 Reconciliation Action Plan - includes several quantitative and qualitative targets related to indigenous peoples in Australia.

23,,"2.3ÃÂ ÃÂ Ã Target implementation and monitoring \nFor each target separately:\nShow that your bank has implemented the actions it had previously defined to meet the set target. \nReport on your bankÃ¢ÂÂs progress since the last report towards achieving each of the set targets and the impact your progress resulted in, using the indicators and KPIs to monitor progress you have defined under 2.2.\nOr, in case of changes to implementation plans (relevant for 2nd and subsequent reports only): describe the potential changes (changes to priority impact areas, changes to indicators, acceleration/review of targets, introduction of new milestones or revisions of action plans) and explain why those changes have become necessary.","Measures and actions we plan to put in place include: implementing and reviewing effective policies and processes on climate change and human rights through our Position Statements and Action Plans; engaging with companies in key sectors to identify alternative approaches and appropriate transition pathways, and increasing to sectors/activities that support positive climate solutions, as well as finance for transition plans/pathways to support our clients; conduct due diligence and assessment of human rights risk within our operations and supply chain. \n\nOur Sustainability Strategy sets out how we are working to better serve our stakeholders and contribute to addressing both local and global challenges. Our 2023 Sustainability Strategy was launched in 2020 and was designed to operate for three years. The strategy had three pillars: helping when it matters most; backing a stronger Australia and New Zealand; and collaborating for impact. Each pillar has a set of performance indicators to report progress. See tab ""Sustainability Strategy"" for our progress against metrics and targets.\n\nIn November 2023, following a review, our refreshed 2030 Sustainability Strategy has been published on our website. It is aligned to the new Group Strategic Intent and our Purpose, reflecting that sustainability is increasingly embedded in how we operate. The refreshed sustainability strategy has been distilled into six objectives, supported by 10 areas for advocacy and 20 focus areas. We aim to report against our new 2023 Sustainability Strategy and performance from FY24.\n\nThe areas for advocacy articulate where we want to lead and positively change how things are done. They were chosen by considering social, ethical and environmental challenges for Australia to overcome and where Westpac could and should seek to influence and/or lead change as a major bank. These areas for advocacy and the focus areas of the strategy were tested for resonance with our consumer customers, retail shareholders and employees.",2023 Sustainability Index and Datasheet: tab Sustainability Strategy \n2023 Climate Report: Strategy; Appendix (Methodology; and Climate Change Position Statement)\nHuman Rights Position Statement and Action Plan \n2023 Annual Report: Creating value for the environment; Creating value for the community\n2023 Interim Financial Results: Sustainability Performance\n2022-2025 Reconciliation Action Plan\n\n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
