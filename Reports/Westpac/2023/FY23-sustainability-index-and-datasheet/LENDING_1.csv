155,,18. The global aviation sector was highly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in emissions intensities higher than the IEA NZE 2050 pathway. Increases in activity as the sector recovers from the pandemic will improve operational efficiencies and result in some reduction in emissions intensity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
156,,"19. Steel represents a very small percentage of WestpacÃ¢ÂÂs lending portfolio and a small number of customers.

Unlike other targets, we will not be disclosing our baseline or progress. Limited independent assurance has been undertaken on the baseline for Steel Production.
