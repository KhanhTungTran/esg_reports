To determine the financial exposure attributable to each TNFD reference sector we apply the ANZSIC1993 â 2006 and ANZSIC 2006 â International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Rev.4 Correspondence Tables to map the ANZSIC code classification for each lending exposure to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) codes used within TNFD Annex 1 of the Sector guidance, Additional guidance for financial institutions Version 2.0 September 2023. Our approach to classifying our lending exposures for TNFD reporting purposes is expected to evolve as we improve our gathering, analysis and reporting of data, acknowledging the current data quality challenges for our underlying lending portfolio.\n\nThe TNFD recognises that: 1) financial institutions have a number of data dependencies on their investees, customers and clients; and 2) when obtaining data on portfolio exposures, financial institutions will often rely on external data providers, and at times, proxy and/ or modelled data. It also recognises that, as companies start to assess and disclose aligned with the TNFD Recommendations, it can be expected that more and better quality data and analytics will become available and that financial institutions may need to make estimates based on the best available information about the locations and activities of companies in preparing its metrics and disclosures.</td>
