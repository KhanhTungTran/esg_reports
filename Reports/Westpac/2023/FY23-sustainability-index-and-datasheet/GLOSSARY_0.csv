6,,INDICATOR OR TERM,DEFINITION
7,,Absenteeism,"The number of actual absentee days lost as a percentage of total days scheduled to be worked by the workforce for the same period. Employees are absent from work because of incapacity of any kind, not as the result of work-related injury, this exclude permitted leave such as holidays, study and parental leave. Includes permanent and maximum term employees. Excludes Pacific and International employees."
8,,Air travel (tCOÃ¢ÂÂ-e),"Calculation Boundary: Air travel undertaken by Westpac employees for business purposes. \n\nCalculation Methodology: Emissions are calculated by multiplying the passenger kilometres travelled by emission factors (including radiative forcing and well-to-tank factors). \nFor Australia, emission factors are sourced from the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting published by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. For New Zealand, emission factors are sourced from the Ministry for the Environment Summary of Emission Factors which includes radiative forcing.\n\nActivity data source: Supplier records."
9,,Alleged code of conduct breaches,"The number of matters referred to WestpacÃ¢ÂÂs Workplace Resolutions team for Australia-based employees. Includes allegations of misconduct or serious misconduct under the GroupÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂConsequence Management FrameworkÃ¢ÂÂ and matters investigated by other internal teams (e.g. Group Investigations). Multiple policies govern conduct obligations , including the Ã¢ÂÂWestpac Group Code of ConductÃ¢ÂÂ."
10,,Australian locations that may experience higher physical risk by 2050,"To assess the possible implications of climate-related physical risks, the Group studied the potential impact of natural perils on its Australian mortgage portfolio. The analysis:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Uses a generalised model of how extreme weather and climate change may affect direct physical risks to a Ã¢ÂÂrepresentative propertyÃ¢ÂÂ, which is an archetype of a modern Australian home using current building codes, under IPCC RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Considers riverine or surface water flooding, coastal inundation, forest fires, extreme wind including cyclones, and soil subsidence.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Computes physical risk for each year from 1990 to 2100, allowing us to assess the potential impacts of current and future extreme weather and climate change.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Models the current portfolio with no growth or movement, and did not consider the impact of adaptation measures or management actions to mitigate risks.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Identifies locations that may be at higher risk and assessed the GroupÃ¢ÂÂs current exposure to these locations. Higher risk were locations where insurance may become more expensive or unavailable.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ This analysis has been used to assess WestpacÃ¢ÂÂs Australian mortgage portfolio exposure to locations identified as likely to be exposed to higher physical risk.\n\n"

12,,Base building (tCOÃ¢ÂÂ-e),"Calculation Boundary: Shared commercial building facilities or services (excludes retail sites) that are attributable to Westpac but not under our direct operational control, including both direct and indirect emissions sources (electricity, natural gas, stationary diesel, transmission and distribution losses). Excludes New Zealand.\n\nCalculation Methodology: Base building landlord supplied data is apportioned to Westpac tenancy (Westpac tenancy NLA/total building NLA). Where landlord data is not available the commercial buildings energy NABERs rating (MJ/m2) is used to estimate electricity, natural gas and stationary diesel usage. Where a commercial building has no landlord data and no NABERs rating, data is estimated based on WestpacÃ¢ÂÂs average portfolio energy per NLA for sites with landlord data. Emissions are calculated by multiplying the base building energy data by relevant emissions factors, sourced from the National Greenhouse Accounts Factors. \n\nActivity data source: Landlord data or estimates based on NLA as detailed in methodology"
13,,Business logistics Ã¢ÂÂ Couriers (tCOÃ¢ÂÂ-e),"Calculation Boundary: For Australia, courier services include the collection of cheque deposits and the non-cash component of Westpac Business Express Deposits from our branches for delivery to state mail hubs. For New Zealand, courier services include cash-in-transit. \n\nCalculation Methodology: For Australia, emissions are calculated by multiplying number of deliveries by the emission factor provided by Australia Post. For New Zealand, data is sourced from our supplier who provides the proportion of their carbon footprint related to Westpac.\n\nActivity data source: Supplier delivery records."

Any other evidence that supports building GHG gas efficiency being in the top 15% of buildings within a given geography OR combinations of buildings within portfolios that achieve the same result may qualify.\nGreen Businesses: Involved in providing green products or services, and consulting. Renewable Energy: Projects qualifying for government renewable energy schemes and\nhydro-electric generation.\nLow carbon transport: Includes national rail and freight systems (where less than 50% of revenues or freight km come from haulage of fossil fuels), urban rail systems, electric vehicles, fuel efficient vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, Bus Rapid Transit, bicycle transport, aviation biofuel, transport logistics.\nAdaptation infrastructure: Infrastructure to increase resilience of existing infrastructure(e.g. bridges and rail) to the physical impacts of climate change. Includes water desalination. \nWaste: Alternate waste treatment, resulting in reduced emissions from landfill.\nWater: Rehabilitation of waterways, water recycling and efficiency. Excludes desalination projects (these are categorised in Ã¢ÂÂAdaptation infrastructureÃ¢ÂÂ).\nCarbon Farming Projects: Qualifying for inclusion in the Carbon Farming Initiative. Low Carbon Agriculture is also allowable, where carbon benefits over conventional farming can be demonstrated.\nForestry: Plantation forestry only.\nLand Rehabilitation: Rehabilitation of contaminated or developed land to natural habitat or other long-term carbon sequestration.\n\nDirect financing refers to structured exposures to specific assets or unstructured exposures to an organisation whose operations are focused on only one type of activity that meets the definition for climate change solutions.\nIndirect financing refers to organisations where one or more of the following apply:\nÃ¢ÂÂ Finance is provided centrally as unstructured lending and forms part of the general\ncapital of the company; and/or\nÃ¢ÂÂ The company has operations other than climate change solutions; and/or\nÃ¢ÂÂ The company operates multiple assets or facilities that are funded centrally.\nFor indirect financing, the total TCE is apportioned so only the portion of climate change solutions activities is included. This is based on available financial information (such as revenues or assets) for the period. In some cases, the TCE is apportioned based on the clean energy generation capacity of the organisation.\nÃ¢ÂÂ Figures are for Australia and New Zealand only, and cover financing undertaken by Westpac Institutional Bank Australia and New Zealand, and WNZL Business Banking."
