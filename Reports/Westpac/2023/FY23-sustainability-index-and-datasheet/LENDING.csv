,5. This target covers customers that produce clinker in-house. The target has been set for customers’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions in relation to the production of cement. It covers emissions generated from calcination in clinker production as well as fuel combustion and electricity consumption associated with the cement production process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In SBTi FLAG (reference scenario we used for setting Agriculture targets), dairy production is expressed in tonnes of fat and protein corrected milk. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
