      <td>We used several methodologies and tools to undertake our impact analysis, with a particular focus on the consumer and business banking portfolios in Australia. \nAs per our Annual Report Note 2 Segment reporting, our Australian consumer division represents more than half of our earnings so to analyse our portfolio impacts, we applied the UNEP FI impact analysis consumer banking module (UNcb). In this analysis we used customer numbers across key products including saving accounts, home loans and credit cards. Our institutional banking activities, along with our New Zealand and Pacific businesses were not covered in the analysis at this stage.\nApplying the UNcb we determined that our consumer portfolio was strongly associated with impacts that could include modern slavery, child labour, health and safety, employment, education, socio-economic convergence, gender equality, inclusion and diversity, indigenous people, climate stability, culture and heritage, water, habitat, species, resources intensity and waste.\n\nWe completed our review with a number of international and national resources (including the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Action Plan for Australia and New Zealand, the SASB materiality matrix, the GRI materiality assessment process and the UNEP FI Context module). We didnât engage with external stakeholders specifically for the purpose of PRBs specifically, however we regularly engage with stakeholders through our yearly sustainability reporting process, as described on our website, and with external stakeholders as part of our materiality assessment process. \n\nThe identified challenges and priorities led us to look more closely at climate change and human rights, because these had already been identified as high priorities and because they are areas of particular interest by our stakeholders. \n\nWe have considered our contribution to climate change and measure our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions to monitor our impact. We have set targets for scope 1, 2 and 3 (upstream) emissions. Given the importance of scope 3 (financed emissions), we measure these at a Group level for customers we lend to. To determine sectors that were the primary contributors to climate change, we relied on the list of carbon-intensive sectors identified by NZBA. We conducted further analysis on each of those sectors and have established 2030 emission reduction targets for 12 sectors. This is described in our Climate Report. \n\nWhile the impact on human rights is relatively low in our core markets of Australia and New Zealand and in our area of operations, we recognise this risk is higher in our supply chain and with the use of our products. We continuously try to improve our identification and assessment to such risks, and this is described in our Human Rights Position Statement and our Modern Slavery Statement. Related performance indicators are included therein. \n\nGiven our analysis we concluded that climate change and human rights were the bankâs areas of most significant impact. We are working with our customers and suppliers to discuss these matters to identify viable transition opportunities, and reduce risks related to both climate change and human rights.</td>

Our updated sustainability strategy is aligned our new purpose and strategic intent and was also informed by our material sustainability issues. The new strategy is not directly based on the PRB, but because it has been based on our purpose and material sustainability issues, it is closely aligned.\n\nUnder our ambition of âRespecting human rights and amplifying Indigenous voicesâ we have set up the target to "Invest up to $30 million to raise awareness of child exploitation and support child protection, and establish a fund to accelerate the development of collaborative technologies". \n\nUnder our ambition to âBecome a net-zero climate resilient bankâ we have plans and targets to:\nâ¢ Reduce our scope 1&amp;2 and scope 3 upstream emissions\nâ¢ Reduce our scope 3 financed emissions including by establishing 12 NZBA sector emission reductions targets within 8 of the 9 carbon-intensive NZBA sectors. \n\nOur 2023 Climate Report, discloses our climate performance and progress against our scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 upstream emissions targets, as well as our scope 3 financed emissions including progress under our NZBA sector targets. \n\nOur progress on human rights is disclosed within the following documents:\nâ¢ 2023 Sustainability Index and Datasheet: tab Sustainability Strategy - includes our progress against human rights targets. \nâ¢ 2023 Annual Report - Community - provide a snapshot of our human rights related actions for FY23.\nâ¢ Modern Slavery Statements FY22 - comprehensive report on our human rights impacts from our operations and supply chain.\nâ¢ 2022-2025 Reconciliation Action Plan - includes several quantitative and qualitative targets related to indigenous peoples in Australia.

The strategy had three pillars: helping when it matters most; backing a stronger Australia and New Zealand; and collaborating for impact. Each pillar has a set of performance indicators to report progress. See tab "Sustainability Strategy" for our progress against metrics and targets.\n\nIn November 2023, following a review, our refreshed 2030 Sustainability Strategy has been published on our website. It is aligned to the new Group Strategic Intent and our Purpose, reflecting that sustainability is increasingly embedded in how we operate. The refreshed sustainability strategy has been distilled into six objectives, supported by 10 areas for advocacy and 20 focus areas. We aim to report against our new 2023 Sustainability Strategy and performance from FY24.\n\nThe areas for advocacy articulate where we want to lead and positively change how things are done. They were chosen by considering social, ethical and environmental challenges for Australia to overcome and where Westpac could and should seek to influence and/or lead change as a major bank. These areas for advocacy and the focus areas of the strategy were tested for resonance with our consumer customers, retail shareholders and employees.</td>
