50,,201.0,Economic Performance,201-02,Financial implications and other risks and opportunities due to climate change,"Key findings from the assessment include:\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ The financial impact of physical climate risk in the store network is not materially significant in the context of ColesÃ¢ÂÂ total portfolio, which is well diversified across assets and regions. In addition, concerning store design, the specifications already consider future conditions to improve resilience in extreme weather (for example, new stores are designed for a one-in-100-year storm event). The design brief is frequently updated.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Flooding events drive approximately 60% of financial losses across the portfolio. The financial impact of flooding events is estimated to increase by around 23% over the next 10 years when assessing against RCP 8.5 2030 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change high-emissions scenario).\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ The distribution network (distribution centres and transport routes) was found to be the area of highest risk due to the scale of potential downstream impacts. Therefore, the distribution network's resilience is a critical consideration in all operations and future asset planning.\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Coles highly relies on asset integrity and the function of third-party assets, such as transport\ninfrastructure, distribution centres and shopping centres. In FY24, we will use these findings to\ninform our climate risk management approach.",,,,Coles,2023.0,,,,Sustainaility_Data_Pack,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
