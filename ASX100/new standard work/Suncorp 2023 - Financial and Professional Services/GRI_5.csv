The report found that, on average, six office locations have moderate exposure to fire and heat under a worst-case climate change scenario mid-century1, with one site having high exposure to precipitation. This year, site-specific assessments were performed with resilience measures recommended for each location that will be incorporated into planned upgrades over the coming years. Suncorp regularly tests its business continuity plan to mitigate the impact of potential risks to its operations and people, including natural hazard events across all businesses.",,,FY23-Climate-related-Disclosure-Report,19,,,"Climate Change Risk, Fire and Heat, Worst-Case Climate Change",13.0,E,,FY23-Climate-related-Disclosure-Report,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In FY22, we developed our Climate Change Scenario Analysis Roadmap (Ã¢ÂÂRoadmapÃ¢ÂÂ) that outlined a pathway to deliver climate-related insights on risks and opportunities. This year, we built a more comprehensive foundation to progress SuncorpÃ¢ÂÂs approach to understanding and managing climate change risk across the business and reaffirming some of SuncorpÃ¢ÂÂs previous CCSA insights. Learnings from this yearÃ¢ÂÂs analysis will be considered part of the GroupÃ¢ÂÂs future net-zero transition plan. We also enhanced our analysis to use address-level climate impact data and uplifted the transition risk scenario design to consider additional risk drivers.

This regular and established modelling exercise assists us in understanding the financial loss potential from extreme weather events today. We have then used climate model projections to alter the behaviour of these weather perils under different climate conditions. The output of this exercise estimates the behaviour of each weather peril under each future climate scenario based on a combination of regional and global climate model outputs.",,,FY23-Climate-related-Disclosure-Report,23,,,"Insurance Business, Physical Damage, Climate Scenario Based",13.0,E,,FY23-Climate-related-Disclosure-Report,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have also considered the systemic risk of transition via disruption and continue enhancing our view of pricing to quantify the threats and understand measures to improve underwriting outcomes. The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPs)1 in Figure 3 represents the baseline scenario incorporating current announced policies on climate transition, and the low level of disruption these have on the sectors noted. Where the pace of transition within each sector changes according to NZE (1.5C), the sectors will experience more climate disruption, including motor, transport, construction, and property.",,,FY23-Climate-related-Disclosure-Report,25,,,"Renewable Energies, Critical Minerals, Stated Policies Scenario",13.0,E,,FY23-Climate-related-Disclosure-Report,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
