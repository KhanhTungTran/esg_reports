27,,2.0,General Disclosures,2-27,Compliance with laws and regulations,"Reviews and enquiries from regulators may result in investigation and administrative costs, system changes, litigation, and regulatory enforcement action (and associated legal fees), compensation and remediation payments (including interest) or fines and penalties. The Group conducts internal reviews of its regulatory compliance, which it may disclose to the regulators in Australia and New Zealand, which may result in similar costs. In recent periods, several regulators in Australia and New Zealand, including ASIC, APRA, ACCC, Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), and the RBNZ and Financial Markets Authority (FMA) in New Zealand conducted reviews and made enquiries with the Group. There were several non-compliance instances identified and disclosed by the Group to ASIC, APRA, AUSTRAC, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Australian Sanctions Office (ASO), the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) and FMA. An assessment of the likely cost to the Group of these matters has been made on a case-by-case basis but can only sometimes be reliably estimated. The amount has been provisioned to the extent that the potential impact can be reliably estimated. During the year, AUSTRAC issued a Compliance Assessment Report concerning SMLÃ¢ÂÂs compliance with its Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) obligations, which included several findings and recommendations. Management has incorporated the suggestions into the Financial Crime Compliance Program of Action (FCC PoA) and continues to keep AUSTRAC informed of its progress. Management is unaware of any pending enforcement action or liability arising from AUSTRACÃ¢ÂÂs findings. The FMA filed proceedings against Vero Insurance New Zealand Limited (VINZL) on 13 October 2022 about the multi-policy discount (MPD) remediation. The claim covers alleged breaches of the fair dealing provisions in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA) concerning the misapplication of MPD. The FMA is seeking a declaration that VINZL contravened certain sections of the Act and for VINZL to pay a pecuniary penalty. The parties are waiting for a court penalty hearing to be set, and a provision for a potential liability has been made. On 31 May 2023, the FMA filed proceedings against AA Insurance Limited (AAI NZ) about its multi-policy discount, NZAA member discount and no claims bonus (NCB) customer remediation activities. The FMA is seeking a declaration that AAI NZ contravened certain sections of the FMCA and for AAI NZ to pay a pecuniary penalty.
