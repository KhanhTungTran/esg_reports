151,,401.0,Employment,401-02,Benefits provided to full-time employees that are not provided to temporary or part-time employees,"If a company in the TSR comparator group is suspended or delisted from the ASX during the performance period, it may be removed from the comparator group. There may, therefore, be fewer than 100 companies in the broad-based comparator group and fewer than 14 companies in the customised comparator group for that period. No LTI related to the TSR performance measure will vest unless the Company achieves a relative 50th percentile (median) or above TSR. Any performance rights not granted at the end of the performance period are lapsed. Further details on TSR, the vesting schedule, and other terms and conditions can be found on page 79 of the Remuneration Report. The fair value of the shares vested measures the fair value of services received in return for LTI granted. The estimate of the fair value of the shares is calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model. It reflects that the vesting of the shares depends on meeting performance criteria based on TSR. The vesting of the shares is also subject to non-market conditions; however, these are not considered in the grant date fair value measurement of the services received.",,,,Suncorp,2023.0,,,,Sustainabiliy Reporting Supp,,159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
