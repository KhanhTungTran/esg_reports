When the iron is poured, any water in the base of the pit gives rise to a process safety risk. If water encounters molten metal, it rapidly heats and can instantly expand up to 1,700 times its original volume. The change from liquid to gas can cause an explosive molten metal/water interaction in a contained space. After a near miss in 2022, the New Zealand Steel team worked with SteelServ, the pit operator, to investigate the control measures for this risk and identify further improvements that were then implemented. These reduced the safety risks, as seen early in 2023 when, despite once-in-a-century rainfall across the region, this process continued to operate without a significant molten metal/water interaction incident.",,,,26,,,"SteelServ, safety risk, metal/water interaction","3, 8",S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
